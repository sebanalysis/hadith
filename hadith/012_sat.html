gets half. The son's daughter gets nothing. Go to Ibn Mas'ud and

informed him about their opinion. He said: I would then be in error

daughters, and said: Apostle of Allah, these are the daughters of
Thabit ibn Qays who was killed as a martyr when he was with you at
the battle of Uhud, their paternal uncle has taken all their property
and inheritance, and he has not left anything for them. What do you
think, Apostle of Allah? They cannot be married unless they have
some property. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Allah
will decide regarding the matter. Then the verse of Surat an-Nisa was
revealed: "Allah (thus) directs you as regards your children's
(inheritance)." Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Call to
me the woman and her husband's brother. He then said to their paternal
uncle: Give them two-thirds and their mother an eighth, and what
remains is yours.

for her share of inheritance. He said: There is nothing prescribed
for you in Allah's Book, nor do I know anything for you in the Sunnah
of the Prophet of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) Go home till I question
the people. He then questioned the people, and al-Mughirah ibn
Shu'bah said: I had been present with the Apostle of Allah
(peace_be_upon_him) when he gave grandmother a sixth. Abu Bakr
said: Is there anyone with you? Muhammad ibn Maslamah stood and
said the same as al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah had said. So Abu Bakr
made it apply to her. Another grandmother came to Umar ibn
al-Khattab asking him for her share of inheritance. He said:
Nothing has been prescribed for you in Allah's Book. The decision
made before you was made for a grandmother other than you. I am
not going to add in the shares of inheritance; but it is that

Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:
<p>
Sa'id said: Umar ibn al-Khattab said: Blood-money is meant for the
clan of the slain, and she will not inherit from the blood-money of
her husband. Ad-Dahhak ibn Sufyan said: The Apostle of Allah
(peace_be_upon_him) wrote to me that I should give a share to the
wife of Ashyam ad-Dubabi from the blood-money of her husband. So
Umar withdrew his opinion. 
<p>
Ahmad ibn Salih said: Abdur Razzaq transmitted this tradition to us
from Ma'mar, from az-Zuhri on the authority of Sa'id. In this
version he said: The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) made him governor
over the bedouins.
