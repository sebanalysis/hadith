It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may 
peace be upon him) said: Verily Allah would make a wind to blow from the side of 
the Yemen more delicate than silk and would spare none but cause him to die 
who, in the words of Abu 'Alqama, has faith equal to the weight of a grain ;

It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that when this verse: 
"O ye who believe I raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet,
nor shout loud unto him in discourse, as ye shout loud unto one another, 
lest your deeds should become null and void, while you perceive not" (xlix. 2-5), 
was revealed.  Thabit b. Qais confined himself in his house and said: I am one 
of the denizens of Fire, and he deliberately avoided coming to the Apostle (may 
peace be upon him).  The Apostle (may peace be upon him) asked Sa'd b, Mu'adh about 
him and said, Abu Amr, how is Thabit?  Has he fallen sick?  Sa'd said: He is my 
neighbour, but I do not know of his illness.  Sa'd came to him (Thabit), and 
conveyed to him the message of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).  
Upon this Thabit said: This verse was revealed, and you are well aware of the fact 
that, amongst all of you, mine is the voice louder than that of the Messenger of 
Allah, and so I am one amongst the denizens of Fire, Sa'd Informed the Holy Prophet 
about it. Upon this the Messenger of Allah observed: (Nay, not so) but he (Thabit) 
is one of the dwellers of Paradise.

It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Shamasa Mahri that he said: We went to 
Amr b. al-As and he was about to die. He wept for a long time and turned his face 
towards the wall. His son said: Did the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him 
not give you tidings of this?  Did the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 
not give you tidings of this?  He (the narrator) said: He turned his face (towards 
the audience) and said: The best thing which we can count upon is the testimony that 
there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.  Verily I have 
passed through three phases. (The first one) in which I found myself averse to none 
else more than I was averse to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and there
was no other desire stronger in me than the one that I should overpower him and kill 
him.  Had I died in this state, I would have been definitely one of the denizens of 
Fire. When Allah instilled the love of Islam in my heart, I came to the Apostle 
(may peace be upon him) and said: Stretch out your right hand so that may pledge 
my allegiance to you. He stretched out his right hand, I withdrew my hand, He (the 
Holy Prophet) said: What has happened to you, O 'Amr? replied: I intend to lay down 
some condition . He asked: What condition do you intend to put forward?  I said: should 
be granted pardon.  He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Are you not aware of the fact that 
Islam wipes out all the previous (misdeeds) ? Verily migration wipes out all the 
previous (misdeeds), and verily the pilgrimage wipes out all the (previous) misdeeds. 
And then no one as or dear to me than the Messenger of Allah and none was more sublime 
in my eyes than he, Never could I, pluck courage to catch a full glimpse of his face 
due to its splendour. So if I am asked to describe his features, I cannot do that for 
I have not eyed him fully.  Had I died in this state had every reason to hope that I 
would have bee among the dwellers of Paradise.  Then we were responsible for certain 
things (in the light of which)I am unable to know what is in store for me. When I die, 
let neither female mourner nor fire accompany me. When you bury me, fill my grave 
well with earth, then stand around it for the time within which a camel is slaughtered 
and its meat is distributed so that I may enjoy your intimacy and (in your company) 
ascertain what answer I can give to the messengers (angels) of Allah.

It is narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that some persons amongst 
the polytheist had committed a large number of murders and had excessively 
indulged in fornication. Then they came to Muhammad (may peace be upon him) and 
said: Whatever you assert and whatever you call to is indeed good. But if you 
inform us that there is atonement of our past deeds (then we would embrace Islam). 
Then it was revealed : 
<blockquote><p>
And those who call not unto another god along with Allah and slay not 
any soul which Allah has forbidden except in the cause of justice, nor 
commit fornication; and he who does this shall meet the requital of sin. 
Multiplied for him shall be the torment on the Day of Resurrection, and he 
shall therein abide disgraced, except him who repents a believes and does 
good deeds. Then these! for the Allah shall change their vices into virtues.

It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that when it was revealed 
to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): To Allah belongs whatever 
is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and whether you disclose that 
which is in your mind or conceal it, Allah will call you to account according 
to it. Then He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He Pleases; and 
Allah is over everything Potent"(ii. 284). the Companions of the Messenger 
of Allah (may peace be upon him) felt it hard and severe and they came to 
the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and sat down on their knees 
and said: Messenger of Allah, we were assigned some duties which were within 
our power to perform, such as prayer, fasting, struggling (in the cause of 
Allah), charity. Then this (the above-mentioned) verse was revealed unto you 
and it is beyond our power to live up to it. The Messenger of Allah (may peace 
be upon him) said: Do you intend to say what the people of two books (Jews and 
Christians) said before you: "We hear and disobey"?  You should rather say: "We 
hear and we obey, (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord! and unto Thee is the 
return." And they said: "We hear and we obey, (we seek) Thy forgiveness, Our 
Lord! and unto Thee is the return." When the people recited it and it smoothly 
flowed on their tongues, then Allah revealed immediately afterwards: "The 
Apostle believes in that which is sent down unto him from his Lord, and so 
do the believers.  Each one believes in Allah and His Angels and His Books 
and His Apostles, saying: We differentiate not between any of His Apostles 
and they say: We hearken and we obey: (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord! 
and unto Thee is the return" (ii. 285).  When they did that, Allah abrogated 
this (verse) and the Great, Majestic Allah revealed: "Allah burdens not a soul 
beyond its capacity. It gets every good that it earns and it suffers every ill 
that it earns. Our Lord, punish us not if we forget or make a mistake." (The 
Prophet said:) Yes, our Lord! do not lay on us a burden as Thou didst lay on 
those before us. (The Prophet said:) Yes, our Lord, impose not on us (burdens) 
which we have not the strength to bear (The Prophet said:) Yes, and pardon us 
and grant us protection! and have mercy  on us. Thou art our Patron, so grant 
us victory over the disbelieving people" (ii. 286).  He (the Lord) said: Yes.

the innermost (root) of the hearts of people.  Then the Qur'an was revealed 
and they learnt from the Qur'an and they learnt from the Sunnah.  Then he 
(the Holy Prophet) told us about the removal of trustworthiness.  He said : 
The man would have a wink of sleep and trustworthiness would be taken away from 
his heart leaving the impression of a faint mark.  He would again sleep and 
trustworthiness would be taken away from his heart leaving an impression of 
a blister, as if you rolled down an ember on your foot and it was vesicled.  
He would see a swelling having nothing in it.  He (the Holy Prophet) then 
took up a pebble and rolled it down over his foot and (said) : The people 
would enter into transactions amongst one another and hardly a person would 
be left who would return (things) entrusted to him.  (And there would be so 
much paucity of honest persons) till it would be said: There in such a such 
tribe is a trustworthy man.  And they would also say about a person: How 
prudent he is, how broad-minded he is and how intelligent he is, whereas in 
his heart there would not be faith even to the weight of a mustard seed.  
I have passed through a time in which I did not care with whom amongst you 
I entered into a transaction, for if he were a Muslim his faith would compel 
him to discharge his obligations to me and it he were a Christian or a Jew, 
the ruler would compel him to discharge his obligations to me.  But today I

A'isha, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), reported:
The first (form) with which was started the revelation to the Messenger of Allah was
the true vision in sleep.  And he did not see any vision but it came like the bright
gleam of dawn.  Thenceforth solitude became dear to him and he used to seclude
himself in the cave of Hira', where he would engage in tahannuth (and that is a
worship for a number of nights) before returning to his family and getting provisions
again for this purpose.  He would then return to Khadija and take provisions for a
like period, till Truth came upon him while he was in the cave of Hira'.  There came
to him the angel and said : Recite, to which he replied : I am not lettered.  He took
hold of me [the Apostle said] and pressed me, till I was hard pressed ; thereafter he
let me off and said : Recite.  I said : I am not lettered.  He then again took hold of me
and pressed me for the second time till I was hard pressed and then let me off and
said : Recite, to which I replied : I am not lettered.  He took hold of me and pressed
me for the third time, till I was hard pressed and then let me go and said: Recite in the
name of your Lord Who created, created man from a clot of blood.  Recite.  And your
most bountiful Lord is He Who taught the use of pen, taught man what he knew not
(al-Qur'an, xcvi. 1-4).  Then the Prophet returned therewith, his heart was trembling,
and he went to Khadija and said : Wrap me up, wrap me up ! So they wrapped him till
the fear had left him. He then said to Khadija: O Khadija! what has happened to me ?
and he informed her of the happening, saying: I fear for myself.  She replied: It can't 
be.  Be happy.  I swear by Allah that He shall never humiliate you.  By Allah, you join
ties of relationship, you speak the truth, you bear people's burden, you help the destitute,
you entertain guests, and you help against the vicissitudes which affect people. 
Khadija then took him to Waraqa b. Naufal b. Asad b. 'Abd al-'Uzza, and he was the
son of Khadija's uncle, i.e., the brother of her father.  And he was the man who had
embraced Christianity in the Days of Ignorance (i.e. before Islam) and he used to write 
books in Arabic and, therefore, wrote Injil in Arabic as God willed that he should
write.  He was very old and had become blind Khadija said to him: O uncle! listen to
the son of your brother.  Waraqa b. Naufal said: O my nephew! what did you see? The
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), then, informed him what he had seen, and
Waraqa said to him: It is namus that God sent down to Musa.  Would that I were
then (during your prophetic career) a young man.  Would that I might be alive
when your people would expel you!  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)
said: Will they drive me out ? Waraqa said: Yes.  Never came a man with a like of what
you have brought but met hostilities.  If I see your day I shall help you wholeheartedly.

lighter. I then kept going back and forth between my Lord Blessed and Exalted and
Moses, till He said: There are five prayers every day and night. O Muhammad, each
being credited as ten, so that makes fifty prayers.  He who intends to do a good deed
and does not do it will have a good deed recorded for him ; and if he does it, it will be
recorded for him as ten; whereas he who intends to do an evil deed and does not do,
it will not be recorded for him; and if he does it, only one evil deed will be recorded.
I then came down and when I came to Moses and informed him, he said: Go back to
thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. Upon this the Messenger of Allah
remarked : I returned to my Lord until I felt ashamed before Him.

Anas b. Malik reported : Abu Dharr used to relate that the Messenger of
Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The roof of my house was cleft when I was in
Mecca and Gabriel descended and opened my heart and then washed it with the water
of Zamzam.He then brought a gold basin full of wisdom and faith and after emptying
it into my breast, he closed it up.  Then taking me by he hand, he ascended with me
to th heaven, and when we came to the lowest heaven, Gabriel said to the guardian
of the lowest heaven: Open. He asked who was there? He replied . It is Gabriel. He
again asked whe he there was someone with him.  He replied: Yes, it is Muhammad
with me. He was asked if he had been sent for, He (Gabriel) said: Yes . Then he opened
(the gate).  When we ascended the lowest heaven (I saw) a man seated with parties
on his right side and parties on his left side.  When he looked up to his right, he laughed
and when he looked to his left, he wept.  He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle
and the righteous son.  I asked Gabriel who he was and he replied: He is Adam
(peace be upon him) and these parties on his right and on his left are the souls
of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inmates of Paradise and the
parties which are on his left side are the inmates of Hell ; so when he looked towards
his right side, he laughed, and when he looked towards his left side, he wept.  Then
Gabriel ascended with me to the second heaven.  He asked its guardian to open (its
gate), and its guardian replied in the same way as the guardian of the lowest heaven
had said.  He (opened it).  Anas b. Malik said: He (the Holy Prophet) mentioned that
he found in the heavens Adam, Idris, Jesus, Moses and Abraham (may peace be on all of
them), but he did not ascertain as to the nature of their abodes except that he had found
Adam in the lowest heaven and Abraham in the sixth heaven.  When Gabriel and the
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) passed by Idris (peace be upon him) he
said : Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous brother.  He (the narrator) said:
He then proceeded and said : Who is he ? Gabriel replied : It is Idris.  Then I passed by
Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: Welcome tothe righteous apostle and righteous
brother.  I said to (Gabriel) : Who is he ? He replied : It is Moses.  Then I passed by Jesus
and he said : Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous brother.  I said (to
Gabriel) : Who is he ? He replied : Jesus, son of Mary.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then
I went to Ibrahim (peace be upon him).  He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle
and righteous son. I asked : Who is he ? He (Gabriel) replied : It is Abraham.  Ibn
Shihab said: Ibn Hazm told me that Ibn 'Abbas and Abd Habba al-Ansari used to say
that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said : Thereafter he ascended with
me till I was taken to such a height where I heard the scraping of the pens. Ibn
Hazm and Anas told that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said : Allah
then made fifty prayers obligatory for my Ummah and I returned with that and passed
by Moses.  Moses, (peace be upon him) said : What has thy Lord enjoined on thy people ?
I said : Fifty prayers have been made obligatory on them.  Moses (peace be upon him)
said : Return to thy Lord, for thy Ummah would not be able to bear this burden.  Then
I came back to my Lord and He remitted a portion out of thut.  I then again went to
Moses (peace be upon him) and informed him about it He said : Return to thy Lord,
for thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden.  I then went back to my Lord
and He said : They are five and at the same time fifty, and what has been said will not be
changed. I then returned to Moses and he said: Go back to thy Lord. whereupon I said :
I feel ashamed of my Lord.  Gabriel then travelled with me till we came to the farthest
lote-tree Many a colour had covered it which I do not know.  Then I was admitted to
Paradise and saw in it domes of pearls, and its soil of musk.

Anas b. Malik reported on the authority of Malik b. Sa sa', perhaps a person
of his tribe, that the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was near the
House (i.e. Ka'bah) in a state between sleep and wakefulness when I heard someone
say : He is the third among the two persons. Then he came to me and took me with
him. Then a golden basin containing the water of Zamzam was brought to me and my
heart was opened up to such and such (part).  Qatada said: I asked him who was with
me (i e. the narrator) and what he meant by such and such (part).  He replied: (It means
that it was opened) up to the lower part of his abdomen (Then the hadith continues):
My heart was extracted and it was washed with the water of Zamzam and then it was
restored in its original position, after which it was filled with faith and wisdom. I was
then brought a white beast which is called al-Buraq, bigger than a donkey and smaller
than a mule.  Its stride was as long as the eye could reach. I was mounted on it, and
then we went forth till we reached the lowest heaven.  Gabriel asked for the (gate) to be
opened, and it was said: Who is he?  He replied: Gabriel .It was again said: Who is
with thee?  He replied: Muhammad (may peace be upon him).  It was said: Has he been
sent for?  He (Gabriel) said: Yes.  He (the Prophet) said : Then (the gate) was opened
for us (and it was said) : Welcome unto him ! His is a blessed arrival.  Then we came to
Adam (peace be upon him).  And he (the narrator) narrated the whole account of the
hadith. (The Holy Prophet) observed that he met Jesus in the second heaven, Yahya
(peace be on both of them) in the third heaven, Yusuf in the third, Idris in the fourth,
Harun in the fifth (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them).  Then we travelled on
till we reached the sixth heaven and came to Moses (peace be upon him) and I greeted
him and he said: Welcome unto righteous brother and righteous prophet.  And when I
passed (by him) he wept, and a voice was heard saying: What makes thee weep ? He
said: My Lord, he is a young man whom Thou hast sent after me (as a prophet) and his
followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.  Then we travelled
on till we reached the seventh heaven and I came to Ibrahim.  He (the narrator) narrat-
ed in this hadith that the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) told that he saw
four rivers which flowed from (the root of the lote-tree of the farthest limits) : two
manifest rivers and two hidden rivers.  I said : ' Gabriel ! what are these rivers ? He
replied :The two hidden rivers are the rivers of Paradise, and as regards the two
manifest ones, they are the Nile and the Euphrates. Then the Bait-ul-Ma'mur was
raised up to me.  I said : O Gabriel! what is this?  He replied: It is the Bait-ul-Ma'mur.
Seventy thousand angels enter into it daily and, after they come out, they never return
again. Two vessels were then brought to me. The first one contained wine and the
second one contained milk, and both of them were placed before me. I chose milk. It
was said: You did right.  Allah will guide rightly through you your Ummah on the
natural course.  Then fifty prayers daily were made obligatory for me. And then he
narrated the rest of the hadith to the end.

things, and he who affirmed even one of them fabricated the greatest lie against Allah.
I asked that they were.  She said: He who presumed that Muhammad (may peace be upon
him) saw his Lord (with his ocular vision) fabricated the greatest lie against Allah. I
was reclining but then sat up and said: Mother of the Faithful, wait a bit and do not
be in a haste.  Has not Allah (Mighty and Majestic) said: "And truly he saw him on the
clear horizon" (al-Qur'an, lxxxi. 23) and "he saw Him in another descent" (al-Qur'an,
iiii. 13)?  She said: I am the first of this Ummah who asked the Messenger of Allah
(may peace be upon him) about it, and he said: Verily he is Gabriel. I have never
seen him in his original form in which he was created except on those two occasions (to
which these verses refer); I saw him descending from the heaven and filling (the space)
from the sky to the earth with the greatness of his bodily structure.  She said: Have
you not heard Allah saying.  "Eyes comprehend Him not, but He comprehends (all)
vision. and He is Subtle, and All-Aware" (al-Qur'an, v. 104)? (She, i.e. 'A'isha, further
said): Have you not heard that, verily, Allah says: "And it is not vouchsafed to a
human being that Allah should speak unto him otherwise than by revelation, or from  
behind a veil, or that He sendeth a messenger (angel), so that he revealth whatsoever
He wills. Verily He is Exalted. Wise" (al. Qur'an, xii. 51)She said: He who presumes
that the Messengerof Allah (may peace be upon him) concealed anything, from the Book,
of Allah fabricates the greatest lie against Allah.  Allah says: "O Messenger ! deliver
that which has been revealed to thee from thy Lord, and if thou do (it) not, thou hast
not delivered His message" (al-Qur'an, v. 67).  She said: He who presumes that he
would inform about what was going to happen tomorrow fabricates the greatest lie
against Allah.  And Allah says "Say thou (Muhammad): None in the heavens and the
earth knoweth the unseen save Allah" (al-Qur'an, xxvii 65).

Abu Haraira reported: The people said to the Messenger of Allah (may
peace be upon him): Messenger of Allah, shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?  
The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do you feel any trouble
in seeing the moon on the night when it is full?  They said: Messenger of Allah, no.
He (the Messenger) further said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun, when
there is no cloud over it?  They said: Messenger of Allah. no.  He (the Holy Prophet)
said: Verily you would see Him like this (as you see the sun and the moon).  God will
gather people on the Day of Resurrection and say: Let every people follow what they
worshipped.  Those who worshipped the sun would follow the sun, and those who worshipped 
the moon would follow the moon, and those who worshipped the devils would
follow the devils. This Ummah (of Islam) alone would be left behind and there
would be hypocrites too amongst it.  Allah would then come to them in a form other
than His own Form, recognisable to them, and would say: I am your Lord.  They would
say: We take refuge with Allah from thee.  We will stay here till our Lord comes to us.
and when our Lord would come we would recognise Him.  Subsequently Allah would
come to them in His own Form, recognisable to them, and say: I am your Lord. They
would say: Thou art our Lord.  And they would follow Him, and a bridge would be set
over the Hell; and I (the Holy Prophet) and my Ummah would be the first to pass
over it; and none but the messengers would speak on that day, and the prayer of the
messengers on that day would be: O Allah ! grant safety, grant safety.  In Hell, there
would be long spits like the thorns of Sa'dan He (the Holy Prophet) said: Have
you seen Sa'dan?  They replied: Yea, Messenger of Allah.  He said: Verily those
(hooks) would be like the thorns of Sa'dan, but no one knows their size except
Allah.  These would seize people for their misdeeds.  Some of them would escape
for their (good) deeds, and some would be rewarded for their deeds till they get
salvation.  When Allah would finish judging His bondsmen and because of His mercy
decide to take out of Hell such people as He pleases.  He would command the
angels to bring out those who had not associated anything with Allah; to whom
Allah decided to show mercy. those who would say: There is no god but Allah.
They (the angels) would recognise them in the Fire by the marks of prostration, for
Hell-fire will devour everything (limb) of the sons of Adam except the marks of prostra-
tion.  Allah has forbidden the fire to consume the marks of prostration.  They will
be taken out of the Fire having been burnt, and the water of life would be poured
over them, and they will sprout as seed does In the silt carried by flood.  Then Allah
would finish judging amongst His bondsmen; but a man who will be the last to enter
Paradise will remain facing Hell and will say: O my Lord I turn my face away from
Hell, for its air has poisoned me ard its blaze has burnt me.  He will then call to Allah
as long as Allah would wish that he should call to Him.  Then Allah, Blessed and
Exalted, would say: If I did that, perhaps you would ask for more than that.  He
would say: I would not ask You more than this, and he would give his Lord covenants
and agreements as Allah wished, and so He would turn his face away from the Fire
When he turns towards the Paradise and sees it, he will remain silent as long as Allah
wishes him to remain so.  He will then say: O my Lord I bring me forward to the gate
of the Paradise.  Allah would say to him: Did you not give covenants and agreements
that you would not ask for anything besides what I had given you.  Woe to thee ! O
son of Adam, how treacherous you are ! He would say: O my Lord ! and would
continue calling to Allah till He. would say to him: If I grant you that, perhaps you
will ask for more.  He will reply: No, by Thy greatness, and he will give His Lord
promises and covenants as Allah had wished He would then bring him to the gate of
the Paradise, and when he would stand at the gate of the Paradise, it would lay open
before him. and he would see the bounty and the joy that there is in it.  He would
remain quiet as long as Allah would desire him to remain silent.  He would then say:
O my Lord, admit me to Paradise.  Allah.  Blessed and Exalted, would say: Did you
not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything more than
what I had granted you?  Woe to you ! son of Adam, how treacherous you are!  And he
would say: O my Lord, I do not wish to be the most miserable of Thy creatures.  He
would continue calling upon Allah till Allah.  Blessed and Exalted. would laugh.  When
Allah would laugh at him.  He would say: Enter the Paradise.  When he would enter,
Allah would say: State your wish.  He would express his wishes till Allah would remind
him (the desire of) such and such (things).  When his desires would be exhausted Allah
would say: That is for thee and, besides it, the like of it also.  'Ata' b. Yazid said:
Abu Sa'id al-Khudri was with Abu Huraira and be did not reject anything from the
hadith narrated by him, but when Abu Huraira narrated: "Allah said to that man;
ind its like along with it," Abu Sa'id said: "Ten like it along with it," O Abu
Huraira.  Abu Huraira said: I do not remember except the words: "That is for you
and a similar one along with it." Abu Sa'id said: I bear witness to the fact that I
remembered from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) his words: "That
is for thee and ten like it." Abu Huraira said: That man was the last of those
deserving of Paradise to enter Paradise.

said: You will not feel any trouble in seeing Allah on the Day of Resurrection any
more than you do in seeing any one of them.  When the Day of Resurrection comes a
Mu'adhdhin (a proclaimer) would proclaim: Let every people follow what they used to
worship.  Then all who worshipped idols and stones besides Allah would fall into the
Fire, till only the righteous and the vicious and some of the people of the Book
who worshipped Allah are left.  Then the Jews would be summoned, and it would be said
to them: What did you worship?  They will say: We worshipped 'Uzair, son of Allah.
It would be said to them: You tell a lie; Allah had never had a spouse or a son.  What
do you want now?  They would say: We feel thirsty, O our Lord I Quench our thirst.  They
would be directed (to a certain direction) and asked: Why don't you go there to drink
water?  Then they would be pushed towards the Fire (and they would find to their great
dismay that) it was but a mirage (and the raging flames of fire) would be consuming
one another, and they would fall into the Fire.  Then the Christians would be summoned
and it would be said to them: What did you worship?  They would say: We worshipped
Jesus, son of Allah.  It would be said to them: You tell a lie; Allah did not take for
Himself either a spouse or a son.  Then it would be said to them: What do you w4nt?
They would say: Thirsty we are, O our Lord ! Quench our thirst.  They would be
directed (to a certain direction) and asked: Why don't you go there to get water?  But
they would be pushed and gathered together towards the Hell, which was like a mirage
to them, and the flames would consume one another.  They would fall Into the Fire, till
no one is left except he who worshipped Allah, be he pious or sinful.  The Lord
of the Universe, Glorified and Exalted, would come to them in a form recognisable to
them and say; What are you looking for?  Every people follow that which they
worshipped.  They would say: Our Lord, we kept ourselves separate from the people in
the world, though we felt great need of them; we, however, did not associate ourselves
with them.  He would say: I am your Lord.  They would say: We take refuge with
Allah from thee and do not associate anything with Allah.  They would repeat it twice
or thrice, till some of them would be about to return.  It would be said: Is there any
sign between you and Him by which you will recognise Him?  They would say: Yes.
and the things would be laid bare. Those who used to prostrate themselves before
God of their own accord would be permitted by God to prostrate themselves.  But
there would remain none who used to prostrate out of fear (of people) and ostentation
but Allah would make his back as one piece, and whenever he would attempt to prostrate
he would fall on his back. Then they would raise their heads and He would assume
the Form in which they had seen Him the first time and would say: I am your Lord.
They would say: Thou art our Lord.  Then the bridge would be set up over the Hell
and intercession would be allowed and they will say: O God, keep safe, keep safe. It
was asked: Messenger of Allah, what is this bridge?  He said: The void in which one
Is likely to slip.  There would be hooks, tongs, spits like the thorn that is found in
Najd and is known as Sa'dan.  The believers would then pass over within the twinkling
of an eye, like lightning, like wind, like a bird, like the finest horses and camels.Some
will escape and be safe, some will be lacerated and let go, and some will be pushed
into the fire of Hell till the believers will find rescue from the Fire.  By One in
Whose hand is my life, there will be none among you more eager to claim a right than
the believers on the Day of Resurrection for (saying their) brethren in the Fire who
would say: O our Lord, they were fasting along with us, and praying and performing
pilgrimage.  It will be said to them: Take out those whom you recognise.  Then their
persons would be forbidden to the Fire; and they would take out a large number of
people who had been overtaken by Fire up to the middle of the shank or up to the
knees.  They would then say: O our Lord I not one of those about whom Thou didst
give us command remains in it.  He will then say: Go back and bring out those in
whose hearts you find good of the weight of a dinar Then they will take out a large
number of people.  Then they would say: O our Lord ! we have not left anyone about
whom You commanded us.  He will then say: Go back and bring out those in whose
hearts you find as much as half a dinar of good.  Then they will take out a large number
of people, and would say: O our Lord ! not one of those about whom Thou commanded
us we have left in it.  Then He would say: Go back and in whose heart you find good
to the weight of a particle bring him out.  They would bring out a large number of
people, and would then say: O our Lord, now we have not left anyone in it (Hell)
having any good in him.<br>
Abu Sa'id Khudri said: If you don't testify me in this hadith, then recite if you
like: "Surely Allah wrongs not the weight of an atom; and if it is a good deed.  He
multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward" (al-Qur'an, iv. 40).  Then Allah,
Exalted and Great, would say: The angels have interceded, the apostles have inter-
  ceded and the believers have interceded, and no one remains (to grant pardon) but the
  Most Merciful of the mercifuls.  He will then take a handful from Fire and bring out from
  it people who never did any good and who had been turned into charcoal, and will cast
  them into a river called the river of life, on the outskirts of Paradise.  They will come
  out as a seed comes cut from the silt carried by flood.  You see it near the stone or near
  the tree.  That which is exposed to the sun is yellowish or greenish and which is under
  the shade is white.  They said: Messenger of Allah ! it seems as if you had been tending
  a flock in the jungle.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: They will come forth like pearls
  with seals on their necks. The inhabitants of Paradise would recognise them (and
  say): Those are who have been set free by the Compassionate One.  Who has admitted
  them into Paradise without any (good) deed that they did or any good that they sent
  in advance Then He would say: Enter the Paradise; whatever you see in it is yours.
  They would say: O Lord, Thou hast bestowed upon us (favours) which Thou didst not
  bestow upon anyone else in the world.  He would say: There is with Me (a favour) for
  you better than this.  They would say: O our Lord ! which thing is better than this?
  He would say: It is My pleasure.  I will never be angry with you after this

<p>It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Mas'ud that the Messenger
of Allah (may peace be upon him said : I recognise the last of the inhabitants of Fire
to be taken out thereof.  A man will come out of it crawling.  It will be said to him:
Go and enter Paradise.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: He would go there to enter
Paradise, but would find persons who have already occupied all its apartments.  It
would be said to him: Do you recall the time when you were in it (in the Hell) ?  He
would say: Yes.  It would be said to him: Express any desire. And he would express
the desire.  It would be said to him: For thee is that which thou desireth and ten times
the world (worldly resources).  He (the Holy Prophet) said: He would say: Art Thou
making a fun of me, though Thou art the King ?  I saw the Messenger of Allah laugh
till his front teeth were visible.

Ibn Mas'ud reported: Verily the Messenger of Allah said: The last to enter
Paradise would be a man who would walk once and stumble once and be burnt by the
Fire once.  Then when he gets beyond it, he will turn to it and say: Blessed is He Who
has saved me from thee.  Allah has given me something He has not given to any
one of those in earlier or later times.  Then a tree would be raised up for him and
he will say: O my Lord I bring me near this tree so that I may take shelter in its
shade and drink of its water.  Allah, the Exalted and Great, would say: O son of Adam,
if I grant you this, you will ask Me for something else.  He would say: No. my Lord.
And he would promise Him that he would not ask for anything else.  His Lord
would excuse him because He sees what he cannot help desiring; so He would bring
him near it, and he would take shelter in its shade and drink of its water.  Afterwards
a tree more beautiful than the first would be raised up before him and he would say:
O my Lord ! bring me near this tree in order that I may drink of its water and take
shelter in its shade and I shall not ask Thee for anything else.  He (Allah) would say:
O son of Adam, if I bring you near it you may ask me for something else.  He would
promise Him that he would not ask for anything else.  His Lord will excuse him because 
He would see something he cannot help desiring.  So He would bring him near it
and he would enjoy its shade and drink its water.  Then a tree would be raised up for
him at the gate of the Paradise, more beautiful than the first two.  He would say: O
my Lord ! bring me near this (tree) so that I may enjoy its shade and drink from its
water.  I shall not ask Thee for anything else.  He (Allah) would say: O son of
Adam ! did you not promise Me that you would not ask Me anything else?
He would say: Yes, my Lord, but I shall not ask Thee for anything else.  His Lord
would excuse him for He sees something the temptation of which he could not resist.
He (Allah) would bring him near to it, and when He would bring him near it he would
hear the voices of the inhabitants of the Paradise.  He would say: O my Lord ! admit
me to it.  He (Allah) would say: O son of Adam, what will bring an end to your requests
to Me?  Will it please you if I give you the whole world and a like one along with it?  He
will say: O my Lord ! art Thou mocking at me, though Thou art the Lord of the
worlds?  Ibn Mas'ud laughed and asked (the hearers) : Why don't you ask me what I
am laughing at.  They (then) said : Why do you laugh?  He said: It is in this way that
the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) laughed.  They (the companions of the
Holy Prophet) asked: Why do you laugh.  Messenger of Allah?  He said: On account
of the laugh of the Lord of the universe, when he ldesirer of Paradise) sai
Thou mocking at me though Thou art the Lord of the worlds?  He would say: I am
not mocking at you, but I have power to do whatever I will.

towards the Paradise, and make a shady tree appear before him.  He would say: O my

large and dark eyes would enter after him.  They will say: Praise be to Allah, Who has

He said . We would come on the Day of Resurrection like this, like this, and see.

people would be summoned along with their idols whom they worshipped, one after

smilingly, and would go along with them and they would follow Him; and every
person, whether a hypocrite or a believer, would be endowed with a light, and there
would be spikes and hooks on the bridge of the Hell, which would catch hold of those
whom Allah willed.  Then the light of the hypocrites would be extinguished, and the
believers would secure salvation. and the first group to achieve it would comprise
seventy thousand men who would have the brightness of full moon on their faces, and
they would not be called to account.  Then the people immediately following them
would have their faces as the brightest stars in the heaven.  This is how (the groups
would follow one after another).  Then the stage of intercession would come, and they
(who are permitted to intercede) would intercede, till he who had declared: "There is
no god but Allah" and had in his heart virtue of the weight of a barley grain would
come out of the Fire.  They would be then brought in the courtyard of Paradise and the
inhabitants of Paradise would begin to sprinkle water over them till they would sprout
like the sprouting of a thing in flood water, and their burns would disappear.  They
would ask their Lord till they would be granted (the bounties) of the world and with
it ten more besides it.

Fire, Thou indeed humillateth him" (al-Qur'an, iii. 192); and All those who endeavoured
to get out of that would be thrown back into it" (al-Qur'an, xxxi i. 20) ? So what is

to which Allah would raise, him?  I said: Yes.  He said: Verily the position of Muhammad
(may peace be upon him) is that of great glory and that is by which Allah would
bring out whornsoever He would wish to bring out.  He then described the Path (the
Bridge) and the passing of the people over it, and said : I am afraid I may not have
remembered (other things) but this much is still in my memory that people would come
out of the Hell after having gone into it, and he said: They would come out of it as

a river, one or the rivers of Paradise, and would bathe in it, and then come out as if
they were (white like) paper.  We then turned back and said: Woe be upon you ! How

This is the hadith which Anas narrated to us.  We went out of his (house) and when
we reached the upper part of Jabban (graveyard) we said: Would that we meet
Hasan and salute him and he was hiding in the house of Abu Khalifa. He (Ma'bad b. 
Hilal, the narrator) said: We went to him and greeted him and we said: O Abu Sa'id,
we come from your brother Abu Hamza (kunya of Anas), and we have never heard a
hadith like this relating to intercession, which he has narrated to us.  He said: Narrate
it, we narrated the hadith.  He said: Narrate it (still further).  We said: He did not
(narrate it) before us more than this.  He said: He (Anas) had narrated it to us twenty
years back, when he was strong and healthy.  He has in fact missed something.  I cannot
make out whether the old man has forgotten or he has (intentionally) avoided to
narrate it to you lest you should rely (absolutely) upon it (and abandon doing good deeds).
We said to him: Relate that to us, and he laughed and said: There is haste in the
nature of man.  I did not make mention of it to you but for the fact that I wanted
to narrate that to you (and added that the Holy Prophet said) : I would then return
to my Lord for the fourth time and extol Him with these praises.  I would then fall in
prostration.  It would be said to me: O Muhammad, raise your head: say and it will be
listened to; ask and it will be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted.
I would say: O my Lord, permit me regarding him who professed: There is no god but
Allah. He (the Lord) would say: That is not for thee or that is not what lies with
thee, but by My Honour, Glory, Greatness and Might, I would certainly take him
out who professed it: There is no god but Allah.  He (the narrator, Ma'bad) said: I
hear testimony to the fact that the hadith transmitted to us-by Hasan was heard by
him from Anas b. Malik and I can see that he reported it twenty years back, when he
was hale and hearty.

to kill. I am concerned with myself, I am concerned with myself.  You better go to Jesus
(peace be upon him).  They would come to Jesus and would say: O Jesus, thou art the
messenger of Allah and thou conversed with people in the cradle, (thou art) His
Word which I-Ie sent down upon Mary. and (thou art) the Spirit from Him; so intercede
for us with thy Lord.  Don't you see (the trouble) in which we are ? Don't you see
(the misfortune) that has overtaken us?  Jesus (peace be upon him) would say: Verily,
my Lord is angry today as He had never been angry before or would ever be angry after-
wards.  He mentioned no sin of his. (He simply said:) I am concerned with myself, I am
concerned with myself; you go to someone else: better go to Muhammad (may peace

of Allah and the last of the apostles.  Allah has pardoned thee all thy previous and
later sins.  Intercede for us with thy Lord ; don't you see in which (trouble) we are ?
Don't you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us ? I shall then set off and come below
the Throne and fall down prostrate before my Lord; then Allah would reveal to me
and inspire me with some of His Praises and Glorifications which He had not revealed
to anyone before me.  He would then say: Muhammad, raise thy head ; ask and it
would be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted I would then raise
my head and say: O my Lord, my people, my people. It would be said: O
Muhammad, bring in by the right gate of Paradise those of your people who would
have no account to render.  They would share with the people some other door besides
this door.  The Holy Prophet then said: By Him in Whose Hand is the life of
Muhammad, verify the distance between two door leaves of the Paradise is as great as
between Mecca and Hajar, or as between Mecca and Busra.

It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that there was placed before
the Messenger of Allah a cup of soft bread, soup and meat.  He took part of the foreleg
which he liked most.  He sliced (with his teeth) a slice (out of that) and said: I would
be the leader of mankind on the Day of Resurrection.  He then sliced (that meat) for
the second time and said: I am the leader of mankind on the Day of Resurrection.
When he saw that his companions did not ask him (about this assertion) he said: Why
don't you say: How would that be ? They said: How would be it, Messenger of Allah?
He said : People would stand before the Lord of the worlds.  And the rest of the hadith
was narrated like the one transmitted by Abu Hayyan, on the authority of Abu Zur'a,
and in the story of Ibrahim, this addition was made.  He said and made mention of his
words with regard to the star: This is my Lord. And his words with regard to their
gods: But the big among them has done that.  And his words: I am ailing. He

Mecca and Hajar or Hajar and Mecca.  I do not remember how he said it (whether

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira and Hudhaifa that the
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Allah, the Blessed and Exalted,
would gather people.  The believers would stand till the Paradise would be brought
near them.  They would come to Adam and say: O our father, open for us the Paradise.
He would say: What turned ye out from the Paradise was the sin of your father
Adam. I am not in a position to do that ; better go to my son Ibrahim, the Friend of
Allah.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: He (Ibrahim) would say: I am not in a position
to do that.  Verily I had been the Friend (of Allah) from beyond, beyond; you better
approach Moses (peace be upon him) with whom Allah conversed.  They would come
to Moses (peace be upon him), but he would say: I am not in a position to do that;
you better go to Jesus, the Word of Allah and His Spirit.  Jesus (peace be upon him)
would say: I am not in a position to do that.  So they would come to Mubammad
(may peace be upon him).  He would then be permitted (to open the door of Paradise).
Trust worthiness and kinship would be despatched, and these would stand on the
right and left of the Path and the first of you would pass with (the swiftness) of lightning.  
He (the narrator) said: I said, O thou who art far dearer to me than my father
and my mother I which thing is like the passing of lightning?  He said: Have you not
seen lightning, how it passes and then comes back within the twinkling of an eye?
Then (they would pass) like the passing of the wind, then like the passing of a bird,
and the hastening of persons would be according to their deeds, and your Apostle would
be standing on the Path saying: Save, O my Lord, save. (The people would go on
passing) till the deeds of the servants would be failing in strength, till a man would
come who would find it hard to go along (that Path) but crawlingly.  He (the narrator)
said: And on the sides of the Path hooks would be suspended ready to catch anyone
whom these would be required (to catch).  There would be those who would somehow
or other succeed in trasversing that Path and some would be piled up in Hell.  By
Him in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Huraira it would take one seventy years to
fathom the depth of Hell.

Husain b. 'Abd al-Rahman reported: I was with Sa'id b. Jubair when he said:
 Who amongst you saw a star shooting last night? I said: It was I; then I said: I was
 in fact not (busy) in prayer, but was stung by a scorpion (and that is the reason
 why I was awake and had a glimpse of the shooting star).  He said: Then what did you
 do? I said: I practised charm.  He said: What urged you to do this?  I said: (I did this
 according to the implied suggestion)of the hadith which al-Shu'ba narrated.  He said: What
 did al-Shu'ba narrate to you?  I said: Buraida b. Husaib al-Aslami narrated to us.  The
 charm is of no avail except in case of the (evil influence) of an eye or the sting of a
 scorpion.  He said: He who acted according to what he had heard (from the Holy
 Prophet) acted rightly, but Ibn 'Abbas narrated to us from the Apostle of Allah (may
 peace be upon him) that he said: There were brought before me the peoples and I saw
 an apostle and a small group (of his followers) along with him, another (apostle) and
one or two persons (along with him) and (still another) apostle having no one with him.
  When a very large group was brought to me I conceived as if it were my Ummah.
   Then it was said to me: It is Moses and his people. You should look at the horizon,
 and I saw a very huge group.  It was again said to me: See the other side of the
 horizon, and there was (also) a very huge group.  It was said to me: This is your Ummah,
 and amongst them there were seventy thousand persons who would be made to enter
 Paradise without rendering any account and without (suffering) any torment.  He then
 stood up and went to his house.  Then the people began to talk about the people who
 would be admitted to Paradise without rendering any account and without (suffering)
   any torment.  Some of them said: They may be those who (have had the good fortune
 of living) in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and some
 of them said: They be those who were born in Islam and did not associate anything
 with Allah. Some people mentioned other things. Thereupon came forth the Messenger
 of Allah (may peace be upon him) before them and he said: What was that which you were
 talking about?  They informed him.  He said: They are those persons who neither
 practise charm, nor ask others to practise it, nor do they take omens, and repose
 their trust in their Lord.  Upon this 'Ukkasha b. Mihsan stood up and said: Supplicate
 for me that He should make me one among them.  Upon this he (Messenger of Allah)
 said: Thou are one among them.  Then another man stood up and said: Supplicate
 before Allah that He should make me one among them.  Upon this he said: 'Ukkisha

<blockquote>
<p>
Before we close the "Kitab-ul-Iman," it seems necessary to bring a few facts before
our readers.  This book deals with the beliefs, i.e. those unseen realities which we
have a strong yearning to comprehend, but which elude the grasp of our senses.</p>
<p>
  Every person, who is endowed with consciousness, is instinctively impelled to
know whence he came and where he would return.  What would become of him after
crossing the bar of life?  Is the short span of this wordly life the culmination of all his
hopes and desires and nothing remains after it?  These are the questions which agitate
the mind of every man, whether he is a believer or a non-believer, whether he is a
monotheist or a polytheist or an atheist.  We cannot silence the echoes of our souls
by simply saying that nothing can be said with certainty about them.  The mind
yearns for definite and satisfactory answers to all of them.  That is what is embedded
in our very nature and so long as we are human beings we  cannot afford to ignore
them.  We approach scientists for the solution of these spiritual problems of ours which
have a direct bearing on our social life, but scientists have no definite answers to give
since they are concerned only with observable facts, that is to say, the optically present
source of sensation, which forms only a fraction of man's life and the vast sea of
"unseen world" lies hidden before them.  That is the reason why even a scientist has
to fall back upon chance-a very imortant admission as to the limits of the so-called
scientific knowledge and the possibility of another knowledge unknown to science and
altogether different from that with the help of which we observe physical phenomena
and their laws.</p>
<p>
Moreover, the scientific method cannot help us solve the problem of "whence" and
"whither".  There is always an urge in our hearts to peep across this life hemmed in by
space and time and find out our ultimate destiny.  Since science deals with "actual,"
with what is here and now, particularly what can be comprehended with the helpof senses, there 
is inherent in science a natural tendency to assure that man, too, like
inanimate matter, is a bubble that bursts and a vision that fades.  If we take this view
of man, which is the inevitable conclusion of the so-called "scientific inquiry," the
whole of human life in which man plays such a prominent role becomes a meaningless
riddle, for he is denied the existence of spiritual yearning in him which is nothing but
a sort of cruel joke with man.  "Life," says Dr Muhammad Iqbal <i><b>(Reconstruction of
Religious Thought in Islam, pp 50-1),</b></i> "with its intense feeling of spontaneity 
constitutes a centre of indetermination, and thus falls outside, the domain of necessity. . . 
The biologist who seeks a mechanical explanation of life is led to do so because he
confines his study to the lower forms of life whose behaviour discloses resemblances to
mechanical action.  If he studies life as manifested in himself, i.e., his own mind freely
choosing, rejecting, reflecting, surveying the past and the present, and dynarnically
imagining the future. he is sure to be convinced of the inadequacy of his mechancal
concepts."</p>
<p>
  The observable facts or, in other words, the physical entities form only a part of
the Reality.  On how to know and comprehend the other parts which concern us more
intimately than the physical entities. science has nothing definite to say except a
meaningful silence which betrays its natural limitation in solving these vital problems
of life.</p>
<p>
  Psychology, too, is inherently incompetent to comprehend the unseen Realities of
the universe.  Life, as we all know. is a great mystery everrin its biological aspects;
how mysterious it is in its spiritual and moral aspects, we cannot imagine.  Psychology
has been-able to grope in the darkness of unconscious and ,ub-conscious chambers and
has not been able to bring into light the secrets of the human soul.  "Psychology," says
Waiter Leibrecht (Religion and Culture, p. 33), "can show us what man is not.  It
cannot tell us what man, each one of us, is.  The legitimate aim of psychology is the
negative, the removal of distortions and illusions, but not the positive, the full and
complete knowledge of human being." The fact is that human knowledge and intellect,
in spite of their boastful claims, are by nature so much handicapped that they, unaided
by revelation, cannot in any way comprehend the unseen Realities.  What the intellect
at the most can do is to transform the sense-data into conceptual forms, but it has to
depend ultimately upon experience and is, therefore, subjected to the same limitations
to which the knowledge of pysical sciences is subjected. "The intellect," say Ibn
Khaldun, is a correct scale.  Its indications are completely certain and in no way
wrong.  However, the intellect should not be used to weigh such matters as the oneness
of God, the Hereafter, the truth of prophecy, the real character of Divine Attributes,
or anything else that lies beyond the level of the intellect.  That would mean to aspire
for the impossible.  One might compare it with a man who sees a scale in which gold is
being weighed, and wants to weigh mountains in it.  This (the fact that it is impossible)
does not prove that the indications of the scale are not true (when it is used for its
proper purpose).  However, there is a limit at which intellect must stop.  It cannot go
beyond its own level" <i><b>(The Muqaddimah, translated by Franz Rosenthal, Vol.  III.
p. 38).</b></i>  What a man in the cold regions of an arid intellectualism can, at his best, 
infer is only the existence of a Prime Cause, but to far as His Attributes, His will, His
behaviour with humanity and His Creation, and our relation with Him are concerned.
Intellect has nothing positive to say.  It is at this stage that man instinctively feels the
need of an agency which shoure provide him authentic information about unseen
rmuties of life. This agencv is known as Prophethoud. The Great Lord, Who has
provided man with materiaf resources for the satisfaction of his macerial needs, has
also made suitable arrangements to acquaint us fully with the Unseen Realities which
our souls yearn to know. This knowledge of the Unseen is vouchsafed to us through
His trusted Messengers (prophets).This is an immense savour from our Lord, immeasurably 
more valuable then the material resources for, without it, human souls
would have suffered the pangs of privation and would have ultimately died. The
Qur'an says:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
All praise is due to Allah.Who guided us to this.And we would not have
found the way if Allah had not guided us. Certainly the Messengers of
our Lord brought the Truth (vii. 43).</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Just as the information of the Holy Prophet pertaining to our worldly life is
perfectly correct judged by any standard, in the same way his revelations concerning
the Unseen. e.g. the Day of Resurrection, Paradise and Hell, will also be perfectly
true. because he As Amin. the Truthful.We should, however, bear in mind that since
we are living in a world of senses it is, therefore, through sensory experiences that we
comprehend it. A man's mind is so much hemmed in by space and time and his vision
is so much limited by the material aspects of his life that it is only through material
concepts that his mind is led to the knowledge of the Unseen. That is the reason why
one can easily find frequent use of metaphors and similes in the language of the
Holy Prophet as be explained the Unseen Realities of existence. These are not myths,
but the Great undeniable Truths which our souls yearn to know, affirm and believe.
but which our own intelligence fails to comprehend.
