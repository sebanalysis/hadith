Narrated Ubaydah ibn as-Samit:
</p>



<p>

I taught some persons of the people of Suffah writing and the Qur'an. A man of them presented to me a bow. I said: It cannot be reckoned  property; may I shoot with it in Allah's path? I must come to the Apostle of of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and ask him (about it). So I came to him and said : Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), one of those whom I have been teaching writing and the Qur'an has presented me a bow, and as it cannot be reckoned property, may I shoot with it in Allah's path? He said: If you want to have a necklace of fire on you, accept it.

<p>

Alaqah passed by a clan (of the Arab) who came to him and said: You have brought what is good from this man. Then they brought a lunatic in chains. He recited Surat al-Fatihah over him three days, morning and evening. When he finished, he collected his saliva and then spat it out, (he felt relief) as if he were set free from a bond. They gave him something (as wages). He then came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and mentioned it to him. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Accept it, for by my life, some accept it for a worthless charm, but you have done so far a genuine one.
