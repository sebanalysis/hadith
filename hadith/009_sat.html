the Rajab sacrifice.

celebrate festival ('Id) on the day of sacrifice, which Allah,

not find except a she-goat or a she-camel borrowed for milk or
other benefits, should I sacrifice it? He said: No, but you should
clip your hair , and nails, trim your moustaches, and shave your
pubes. This is all your sacrifice in the eyes of Allah, Most High.

words "from 'A'ishah" in his version from Malik): They (the people)
said: Apostle of Allah, there are people here, recent converts from
polytheism, who bring us meat and we do not know whether or not
they mentioned Allah's name over it. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)
said: Mention Allah's name and eat.

Narrated Nubayshah:
<p>
A man called the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him): We used to
sacrifice Atirah in pre-Islamic days during Rajab; so what do you
command us? He said: Sacrifice for the sake of Allah in any month
whatever; obey Allah, Most High, and feed(the people). He said: We
used to sacrifice a Fara' in pre-Islamic days, so what do you
command us? He said: On every pasturing animal there is a Fara'
which is fed by your cattle till it becomes strong and capable
of carrying load.  
<p>
The narrator Nasr said (in his version): When it becomes capable
of carrying load of the pilgrims, you may slaughter it and give
its meat as charity (sadaqah). 
<p>
The narrator Khalid's version says: You (may give it) to the
travellers, for it is better. Khalid said: I asked Abu Qilabah:
How many pasturing animals? He replied: One hundred.

Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:
<p>
The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: A boy is in pledge for his
Aqiqah. Sacrifice is made for him on the seventh day, his head
is shaved and is smeared with blood.  
<p>
When Qatadah was asked about smearing with blood, how that should
be done, he said: When you cut the head (i.e. throat) of the
animal (meant for Aqiqah), you may take a few hair of it, place
them on its veins, and then place them in the middle of the head
of the infant, so that the blood flows on the hair (of the infant)
like a threat. Then its head may be washed and shaved off.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: In narrating the word "is smeared with blood" (yudamma)
there is a misunderstanding on the part of Hammam.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: Hammam has been opposed in narrating the words "is
smeared with blood." This is a misunderstanding of Hammam. They
narrated the word "he is given a name (yusamma) and Hammam narrated
it "smeared with blood" (yudamma).
<p>
Abu Dawud said: This tradition is not followed.

aqiqah. He replied: Allah does not like the breaking of ties
(uquq), as though he disliked the name. And he said: If anyone
has a child born to him and wishes to offer a sacrifice on its
behalf, he may offer two resembling sheep for a boy and one for
a girl. And he was asked about fara'. He replied: Fara' is right.
If you leave it (i.e. let it grow till it becomes a healthy camel
of one year or two years, then you give it to a widow or give it
in the path of Allah for using it as a riding beast, it is better
than slaughtering it at the age when its meat is stuck to its hair,
and you turn over your milking vessel and annoy your she-camel.
