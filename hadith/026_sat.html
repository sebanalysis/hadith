Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
<p>
Abu al-Malih said: Some women of Syria came to Aisha. She asked them:
From whom are you? They replied: From the people of Syria. She said:
Perhaps you belong to the place where women enter hot baths (for washing).
The said: Yes. She said: I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)
say: If a woman puts off her clothes in a place other than her house, she
tears the veil between her and Allah, the Exalted.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: This is a tradition narrated by Jarir, and is more perfect.
Jarir did not mention Abu al-Malih. He said (on the authority of 'A'ishah)
that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said.

The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: After some time the lands of the
non-Arabs will be conquered for you, and there you will find houses called
hammamat (hot baths). so men should not enter them (to wash) except in
lower garments, and forbid the women to enter them except a sick or one
who is in a child-bed.
