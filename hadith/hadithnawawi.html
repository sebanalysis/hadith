<h1>
INTRODUCTION
</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds. Eternal Guardian of
the heavens
and the earths, Disposer of all created beings, Despatcher of Messengers
(may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon them all) who were sent to
those they have been entrusted to guide and to reveal the religious laws
to, with positive signs and clear-cut proofs. I praise Him for His favours
and ask Him to increase His grace and generosity. I bear witness that
there is no god but Allah alone, He having no associate, the One, the
Subduer, the Generous, the Pardoner, and I bear witness that our master
Muhammed is His servant and His messenger, His dear one and His beloved,
the best of created beings, who was honoured with the precious Quran, the
enduring miracle through the passing of the years, and with the sunnahs
that enlighten spiritual guides; our master Muhammed, singled out for
pithiness of speech and tolerance in religion may the blessings and peace of
Allah be upon him, upon the rest of the prophets and messengers, and upon
all their families and upon the rest of godly persons.<p>

To proceed: It has been transmitted to us on the authority of Ali bin
Abi Talib, Abdullah bin Masud, Muadh bin Jabal, Abu  Al-Darda, Ibn Omar, Ibn
Abbas, Anas bin Malik, Abu Hurairah and Abu Saeed Al-Khudri, may Allah be
pleased with them all, through many chains of authorities and in various
versions, that the messenger of Allah said: "Whosoever memorises and
preserves for my people forty hadith relating to their religion, Allah
will resurrect him on the Day of Judgment in the company of jurists and
religious scholars ".
<p> 
In another version it reads: "Allah will resurrect him as a jurist
and religious scholar ". In the version of Abu Al-Darda it reads: "On the
Day of Judgment I shall be an intercessor and a witness for him". In the
version of Ibn Masud it reads: "It will be said to him: Enter by
whichever of the doors of Paradise you wish ". In the version of Ibn
Omar it reads: " He will be written down in the company of the
religious
scholars and will be resurrected in the company of the martyrs ". Scholars
of hadith are agreed that it is a weak hadith despite its many lines of
transmission.

<p>
The religious scholars, may Allah be pleased with them,
have composed innumerable works in this field. The first one I knew of
who did so was Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak, followed by Ibn Aslam Al-Tusi, the
godly scholar, then Al-Hasan bin Sufiyan Al-Nasai, Abu Bakr Al-Ajurri,
Abu-Bakr Mubammad bin Ibrahim Al-Asfihani, Al-Daraqutni, Al-Hakim, Abu
Nuaim, Abu Abd Al-Rahman Al-Sulami, Abu Saeed Al-Malini, Abu Uthman Al-Saboni,
Abdullah bin Muhammed Al-Ansari,  Abu Bakr Al-Baihaqi, and countless others,
both ancient and modern.

<p>
I have asked Allah Almightly for guidance in bringing together forty
hadith in emulation af those eminant religious leaders and guardians of
Islam. Religious scholars are agreed it is permissible to put into practice
a weak hadith if virtuous deeds are concerned; despite this, I do not
rely on this hadith but on his having said the [ following ] sound hadith:
 <b>"Let him who was a witness among you inform him who was absent"</b>,
and on his having said : <b>"May Allah make radiant [the face of] someone who has
heard what I have said, has
learnt it by heart and has transmitted it as he heard it"</b>. Furthermore,
there were some religious scholars who brought together forty hadiths on
the basic rules of religion, on subsidiary matters, or on jihad, while
others did so on asceticism, on rules of conduct or on sermons. All these
are godly aims-may Allah be pleased with those who pursued them. I,
however, considered it best to bring together forty hadith more important
than all of these, being forty hadith which would incolporate all of
these, each hadith being one of the great precepts of religion, described
by religious scholars as being  "the axis of Islam " or  "the half of Islam"
or  "the third of it ", or the like, and to make it a rule that these
forty hadith be [classified as] sound and that the majority of them be
in the sahihs of Al-Bukhari and Muslim. I give them without the chains of
authorities so as to make it easier to memorise them and to make them
of wider benefit if Allah Almighty wills, and I append to them a section
explaining abstruse expressions.(Note here) every person wishing to
attain the Hereafter should know these hadith because of the important
matters they contain and the directions they give in respect of all forms
of obedience, this being obvious to anyone who has reflected upon it. On
Allah do I rely and depend and to Him do I entrust myself; to Him be
praise and grace, and with Him is success and immunity [to errors].

<p>
On the authority of Omar bin Al-Khattab, who said : I heared the
messenger of Allah <i>salla Allah u alihi wa sallam</i> say :<br><br>

"Actions are but by intention and every man shall have but that which
he intended. Thus he whose migration was for Allah and His messenger, his
migration was for Allah and His messenger, and he whose migration was
to achieve some worldly benefit or to take some woman in marriage, his
migration was for that for which he migrated."<p>

<br><p>
Also on the authority of Omar, who said :<p>
 One day while we were sitting with the messenger of Allah there appeared
before us a man whose clothes were exceedingly white and whose hair was
exceedingly black;
no signs of journeying were to be seen on him and none of us knew him. He
walked up and sat down by the prophet. Resting his knees against his and
placing the palms of his hands on his thighs, he said:"O Muhammed, tell me about Islam".
The messenger of Allah said: "Islam is to testify that there is no god but Allah and
Muhammed is the messenger of Allah, to perform the prayers, to pay the zakat,

to fast in Ramadhan, and to make the pilgrimage to the House if you are able to do

so." He said:"You have spoken rightly", and we were amazed at him asking

him and saying that he had spoken rightly. He said: "Then tell me about

<i>eman</i>."He said:"It is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day, and to believe in divine destiny, both the

good and the evil thereof." He said:"You have spoken rightly". He said: "

Then tell me about <i>ehsan</i>." He said: "It is to worship Allah as

though you are seeing Him, and while you see Him not yet truly He sees

you". He said: "Then tell me about the Hour". He said: "The one

questioned about it knows no better than the questioner." He said: "Then

tell me about its

signs." He said: "That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and

that you will see the barefooted, naked, destitute herdsman competing in

constructing lofty buildings." Then he took himself off and I stayed for a

time. Then he said: "O Omar, do you know who the questioner was?" I

said: "Allah and His messenger know best". He said: "He was Jebreel

(Gabriel), who came to you to teach you your religion."<br><br>p
   narrated by Muslim<br><br>

:<br><br>



"Islam has been built on five [pillars]: testifying that there is no

god but Allah and that Muhammed is the messenger of Allah, performing

the prayers, paying the zakat, making the pilgrimage to the House, and

fasting in Ramadan."<br><br>p

Allah, and he is the truthful, the believed narrated to us :<br><br>p
"Verily the creation of each one of you is brought together in his mother's

belly for forty days in the form of seed, then he is a clot of blood for

a like period, then a morsel of flesh for a like period, then there is

sent to him the angel who blows the breath of life into him and who is

commanded about four matters: to write down his means of livelihood, his

life span, his actions, and whether happy or unhappy. By Allah, other

than Whom there is no god, verily one of you behaves like the people of

Paradise until there is but an arm's length between him and it, and that

which has been written over takes him and so he behaves like the people

of Hell-fire and thus he enters it; and one of you behaves like the

people of Hell-fire until there is but an arm's length between him and it,

and that which has been written over takes him and so he behaves like the

people of Paradise and thus he enters it."<br><br>p

messenger of Allah say :<br><br>



"That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain and

between the two of them are doubtful matters about which not many people

know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his

religion and his honor, but he who falls into doubtful matters falls into

that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary,

all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allah's

sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh

which, if it be whole, all the body is whole and which, if it be

diseased, all of it is diseased. Truly it is the heart."<br><br>p

they will have gained protection from me for their lives and property, unless

[they do acts that are punishable] in accordance with Islam, and their

reckoning will be with Allah the Almighty."<br><br>

of Me and I shall clothe you. O My servants, you sin by night and by day,

and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness of Me and I shall forgive

you.<p>

O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and you

will not attain benefiting Me so as to benefit Me. O my servants, were the

first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to

become as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that

would not increase My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first

of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as

wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that would not

decrease My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and

the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one

place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he

requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more than a needle

decreases the sea if put into it.<p>

O My servants, it is but your deeds

that I reckon up for you and then recompense you for, so let him who

finds good praise Allah, and let him who finds other than that blame no

one but himself."<p>p

<br><p>

On the authority of Abu Najih Al-Erbadh bin Sariah, who said

:<br><br>p
The messenger of Allah gave us a sermon by which our hearts were filled

with fear and tears came to our eyes. We said: "O Messenger of Allah, it

is as though this is a farewell sermon, so councel us." He said: "I

councel you to fear Allah and to give absolute obedience even if a slave

becomes your leader. Verily he among you who lives [long] will see

great controversy, so you must keep to my sunnah and to the sunnah of

the rightly-guided Khalifahs - cling to them stubbornly. Beware of newly

invented matters, for every invented matter is an innovation and every

innovation is a going astray, and every going astray is in

Hell-fire."<br><br>p

On the authority of Muadh bin Jabal, who said:<br><br>p
I said: "O Messenger of Allah, tell me of an act which will take me into

Paradise and will keep me away from Hell fire." He said: "You have asked me

about a major matter, yet it is easy for him for whom Allah Almighty makes

it easy. You should worship Allah, associating nothing with Him, you

should perform the prayers, you should pay the zakat, you should fast in

Ramadan, and you should make the pilgrimage to the House." Then he said:"

Shall I not show you the gates of goodness ? Fasting [which] is a shield,

charity [which] extigueshes sin as water extebgueshes fire; and the

praying of a man in the deapth of night." Then he recited :<p>



<i><b>"Who forsake their beds to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope,

and spend of that We have bestowed on them. No soul knoweth what is kept hid for

them of joy, as a reward for what they used to do".</b> (quran, verse)</i><p>



 Then he said: " Shall I not tell you of the peak of the matter, its pillar, and its

topmost part?" I said: "Yes, O Messenger of Allah." He

said: "The peak of the matter is Islam; the pillar is prayer; and its

topmost part is jihad." Then he said: "Shall I not tell you of the

controling of all that ?" I said:"Yes, O Messenger of Allah", and he took

hold of his tongue and said: "Restrain this." I said: "O Prophet of Allah,

will what

we say be held against us ?" He said: "May your mother be bereaved of you,

Muadh ! Is there anything that topples people on their faces - or he said

on their noses into Hell-fire other than the jests of their tongues

?"<br><br>p

said :<br><br>p
"Do not envy one another; do not inflate prices one to another; do not hate

one another; do not turn away from one another; and do not undercut one

another, but be you, O servants of Allah, brothers. A muslim is the brother

of a muslim: he neither oppresses him nor does he fail him, he neither

lies to him nor does he hold him in contempt. Piety is right here-and he

pointed to his breast three times. It is evil enough for a man to hold

his brother muslim in contempt. The whole of a muslim for another muslim

is inviolable: his blood, his property, and his honor."<br><br>p

On the authority of Abu Hurairah that the Prophet said: <br><br>p
"Whosoever removes a worldly grief from a believer, Allah will remove from

him one of the griefs of the Day of Judgment. Whosoever alleviates [the

lot of] a needy person, Allah will alleviate [his lot] in this world

and the

next. Whosoever shields a Muslim, Allah will shield him in this world

and the next. Allah will aid a servant [of His] so long as the servant

aids his brother. Whosoever follows a path to seek knowledge therein,

Allah will

make easy for him a path to Paradise. No people gather together

in one of the houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it

among

themselves, without tranquility descending upon them, mercy enveloping them,

the angels surrounding them, and Allah making mention of them amongst those

who are with Him. Whosoever is slowed down by his actions will not be

hastened forward by his lineage."<br><br>p

On the authority of Ibn Abbas that the messenger of Allah, among the

sayings he relates from his Lord is :<br><br>p
"Allah has written down the good deeds and the bad ones." Then he explained

it [by saying that] :" He who has intended a good deed and has not done

it, Allah writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if he has

intended it and has done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as from

ten good deeds to seven hundred times, or many times over. But if he has

intended a bad deed and has not done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as a

full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Allah writes

it down as one bad deed."<br><br>p

Allah the Almighty has said: "Who soever shows enmity to a friend of Mine, I

shall be at war with him. My servant does not draw near to Me with anything

more loved by Me than the religious duties I have imposed upon him, and

My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I

shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his

seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot

with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely

give it to him and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him
