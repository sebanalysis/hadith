  'Ata' reported: The House was burnt during the time of Yazid b. Muawiya
when the people of Syria had fought (in Mecca).  And it happened with it (the Ka'ba)
what was (in store for it).  Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) felt it (in the same
state) until the people came in the season (of Hajj). (The idea behind was) that he
wanted to exhort them or incite them (to war) against the people of Syria.  When the
people had arrived he said to them: O people, advise me about the Ka'ba.  Should I
demolish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever
has been damaged of it?  Ibn 'Abbas said: An idea has occurred to me according to
which I think that you should only repair (the portion which has been) damaged,
and leave the House (in that very state in which) people embraced Islam (and leave
those very stones in the same state) when people embraced Islam, and over
which Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) had raised it.  Thereupon Ibn Zubair
said: It the house of any one of you is burnt, he would not be contented until he had
reconstructed it, then what about the House of your Lord (which is far more Important
than your house)? I would seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I would
make up (my mind) about this affair.  After seeking good advice thrice, he made up
his mind to demolish it.  The people apprehended that calamity might fall from heaven
on those persons who would be first to climb (over the building for the purpose of
demolishing it), till one (took up courage, and ascended the roof), and threw down one
of its stones.  When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him,
demolished it until it was razed to the ground.  Then Ibn Zubair erected pillars and hung  
cartains on them (in order to provide facilities to the people for observing 
the time of its construction).  And the walls were raised; and Ibn Zubair said: I heard
'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) say that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him)
had observed: If the people had Rot recently (abandoned) unbelief, find I had means
enough to reconstruct it, which I had not, I would have definitely excompassed in it
five cubits of area from Hijr.  And I would also have constructed a door for the people
to enter, and a door for their exit. I today have (the means to spend) and I entertain no
fearfrom the side of people (that they would protest against this change).  So he added five
cubits of area from the side of Hatim to it that there appeared (the old) foundation (upon
which Hadrat Ibrahim had built the Ka'ba). and the people saw that and it was upon this
foundation that the wall was raised.  The length of the Ka'ba was eighteen cubits.
when addition was made to it (which was in its breadth), then naturally the length
appears to be) small (as compared with its breadth). Then addition of ten cubits (of
area) was made in its length (also).  Two doors were also constructed, one of which (was
meant) for entrance and the other one for exit.  When Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased
with him) was killed, Hajjaj wrote to 'Abd al-Malik (b.  Marwan) informing him about
it, and telling him that Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) had built (the Ka'ba)
on those very foundations (which were laid by Ibrahim) and which reliable persons
among the Meccans had seen. 'Abd al-Malik wrote to him: We are not concerned with
the censuring of Ibn Zubair in anything.  Keep intact the addition made by him in the
side of length, and whatever he has added frem the side of Hijr revert to (its previous)
foundation, and wall up the door which he had opened.  Thus Hajjaj at the command
of Abd al-Malik) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it on (its previous) foundations.

Abdullah b. 'Ubaid reported that Harith b. 'Abdullah led a deputation
to 'Abd al-Malik b. Marwan during his caliphate.  'Abd al-Malik said: I do riot think
that Abu Khubaib (i.e. Ibn Zabair) had heard from 'A'isha (Allah be pleased

 I would have reversed it to (those foundations) which they had left out of it. nd if

 to it: "Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: I would have made two doors
 on the level of the ground (facing) the east and the west.  Do you know why your
 people raised the level of its door (i.e. the door of the Ka'ba)?  She said: No. He said:
 (They did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to
 him only whom they wished.  When a person intended to get into it, they let him climb
 (the stairs), and as he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down." 'Abd

 (Harith) said that he ('Abd al-Malik) scratched the ground with his staff for some
 time and then said: I wish I had left his (Ibn Zubair's) work there.

it so that he could attribute its transmission to Allah's Messenger (may peace be
