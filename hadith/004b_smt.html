be built for him in Paradise; and I have not abandoned to observe the in after (hearing

Sa'd b. Hisham b. 'Amir decided to participate in the expedition for
the sake of Allah, so he came to Medina and he decided to dispose of his property there
and buy arms and horses instead and fight against the Romans to the end of his life.
When he came to Medina, he met the people of Medina.  They dissuaded him to do
such a thing, and informed him that a group of six men had decided to do so during
the lifetime of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and the Apostle of Allah
(may peace be upon him) forbade them to do it, and said: Is there not for you a model
pattern in me? And when they narrated this to him (Sa'd b. Hisham), he returned
to his wife, though he had divorced her and made (people) witness to his reconciliation.
He then came to Ibn 'Abbas and asked him about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah
(may peace be upon him).  Ibn 'Abbas said: Should I not lead you to one who knows
best amongst the people of the world about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (may
peace be upon him)?  He said: Who is it?  He (Ibn 'Abbas) said: It is 'A'isha. So
go to her and ask her (about Witr) and then come to me and inform me about her
answer that she would give you.  So I came to Hakim b. Aflah and requested him to
take me to her. He said : I would not go to her, for I forbade her to speak anything
(about the conflict) between the two groupS, but she refused (to accept my advice)
and went (to participate in that corflict). I (requested) him (Hakim) with an oath to
lead me to her. So we went to 'A'isha and we begged permission to meet her. She
granted us permission and we went in. She said: Are you Hakim? (She recognised him.)
He replied: Yes. She said: Who is there with you ? He said: He is Sa'd b. Hisham.
She said: Which Hisham ? He said: He is Hisham b. 'Amir. She blessed him ('Amir)
with mercy from Allah and spoke good of him (Qatada said that he died as a martyr
in Uhud). I said: Mother of the Faithful, tell me about the character of the
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: Don't you read the Qur'an ? I
said: Yes. Upon this she said: The character of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be
upon him) was the Qur'an. He said: I felt inclined to get up and not ask anything
(further) till death. But then I changed my mind and said: Inform me about the
observance (of the night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).
She said: Did you not recite: "O thou wrapped up"?  He said: Yes. She said:
Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, made the observance of the night prayer at the
beginning of this Surah obligatory. So the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him
and his Companions around him observed this (night prayer) for one year. Allah held
back the concluding portion of this Surah for twelve months in the Heaven till (at the
end of this period) Allah revealed the concluding verses of this Surah which lightened
(the burden of this prayer), and the night prayer became a supererogatory prayer after
being an obligatory one.  I said: Mother of the Faithful, inform me about the Witr of
the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).  She said: I used to prepare tooth
stick for him and water for his ablution, and Allah would rouse him to the extent He
wished during the night.  He would use the tooth stick, and perform ablution, and
would offer nine rak'ahs, and would not sit but in the eighth one and would remember
Allah, and praise Him and supplicate Him, then he would get up without uttering the
salutation and pray the ninth rak'ah. He would then sit, remember, praise Him
and supplicate Him and then utter a salutation loud enough for us to hear.  He would
then pray two rak'ahs sitting after uttering the salutation, and that made eleven
rak'ahs. O my son, but when the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) grew old
and put on flesh, he observed Witr of seven, doing in the two rak'ahs as he had done
formerly, and that made nine. O my son, and when the Apostle of Allah (may peace be
upon him) observed prayer, he liked to keep on observing it, and when sleep or pain
overpowered him and made it impossible (for him) to observe prayer in the night, he
prayed twelve rak'ahs daring the day. I am not aware of Allah's Prophet (may
peace be upon him) having recited the whole Qur'an during one single night, or praying
through the night till morning, or fasting a complete month, except Ramadan.  He
(the narrator) said: I then went to Ibn 'Abbas and narrated to him the hadith (transmitted 
from her), and he said : She says the truth If I went to her and got into her
presence, I would have listened to it orally from her.  He said : If I were to know that
you do not go to her.  I would not have transmitted this hadith to you narrated by her.

  say: On the Day of Resurrection the Qur'an and those who acted according to it will
  be brought with Surah al-Baqara and AI 'Imran preceding them.  The Messenger of
  Allah (may peace be upon him) likened them to three things, which I did not forget

'Amr b. 'Abasa Sulami reported: I in the state of the Ignorance (before
embracing Islam) used to think that the people were in error and they were not on
anything (which may be called the right path) and worshipped the idols. In the
meanwhile I heard of a man in Mecca who was giving news (on the basis of his
prophetic knowledge); so I sat on my ride and went to him.  The Messenger of Allah
(may peace be upon him) was at that time hiding as his people had made life hard for
him.  I adopted a friendly attitude (towards the Meccans and thus managed) to enter
Mecca and go to him (the Holy Prophet) and I said to him: Who are you? He said: I
am a Prophet (of Allah). I again said: Who is a Prophet?  He said: (I am a Prophet in
the sense that) I have been sent by Allah.  I said: What is that which you have been
sent with?  He said: I have been sent to join ties of relationship (with kindness and
affection), to break the Idols, and to proclaim the oneness of Allah (in a manner that)
nothing is to be associated with Him. I said: Who is with you in this (in these beliefs
and practices)?  He said: A free man and a slave.  He (the narrator) said: Abu Bakr
and Bilal were there with him among those who had embraced Islam by that time. I
said: I intend to follow you. He said: During these days you would not be able to do
so. Don't you see the (hard) condition under which I and (my) people are living?
You better go back to your people and when you hear that I have been granted
victory, you come to me. So I went to my family. I was in my home when the
Messengerof Allah (may peace be upon him)came to Medina. I was among my people and
used to seek news and ask people when he arrived in Medina.  Then a group of people
belonging to Yathrib (Medina) came. I said (to them): How is that person getting on
who has come to Medina? They said: The people are hastening to him, while his
people (the polytheists of Mecca) planned to kill him, but they could not do so. I (on
hearing It) came to Medina and went to him and said: Messenger of Allah, do you
recognise me? He said: Yes, you are the same man who met me at Mecca. I said: It is
so. I again said: Prophet of Allah, tell me that which Allah has taught you and which
I do not know, tell me about the prayer.  He said: Observe the dawn prayer, then stop
praying when the sun is rising till it Is fully up, for when it rises it comes up between
the horns of Satan, and the unbelievers prostrate themselves to it at that time.  Then
pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended (by angels) till the shadow becomes about
the length of a lance; then cease prayer, for at that time Hell is heated up.  Then when the
shadow moves forward, pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended by angels, till you
pray the afternoon prayer, then cease prayer till the sun sets, for it sets between the
horns of devil, and at that time the unbelievers prostrate themselves before it.  I said:
Apostle of Allah, tell me about ablution also. He said: None of you who uses water
for ablution and rinses his mouth, snuffs up water and blows it, but the sins of his
face, and his mouth and his nostrils fall out. When he washes his face, as Allah has
commanded him, the sins of his face fall out from the end of his beard with water.
Then (when) he washes his forearms up to the elbows, the sins of his arms fall out along
with water from his finger-tips.  And when he wipes his head, the sins of his head fall
out from the points of his hair along with water.  And (when) he washes his feet
up to the ankles, the sins of his feet fall out from his toes along with water.  And if he
stands to pray and praises Allah, lauds Him and glorifies Him with what becomes
Him and shows wholehearted devotion to Allah, his sins  would depart leaving him
(as innocent) as he was on the day his mother bore him.  'Amr b. 'Abasa narrated
this hadith to Abu Umama, a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon
him), and Abu Umama said to him: 'Amr b. 'Abasa, think what you are saying that
such (a great reward) is given to a man at one place (only in the act of ablution and
prayer).  Upon this 'Amr said: Abu Umama, I have grown old and my bones have
become weak and I am at the door of death; what impetus is there for me to attribute
a lie to Allah and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)?  Had I heard it
from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) once, twice, or three times (even
seven times), I would have never narrated it, but I have heard it from him on
occasions more than these.

beard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) prohibiting them, and then
afterwards I saw him observing them.  And when he observed them (two rak'ahs) he had
already observed the 'Asr prayer.  Then he (the Holy Prophet) came, while there were
with me ladies of Banu Haram, a tribe of the Ansar and he (the Holy Prophet) observed
them (the two rak'ahs). I sent a slave-girl to him asking her to stand by his side
and say to him that Umm Salama says: Messenger of Allah, I heard you prohibiting
these two rak'ahs, whereas I saw you observing them; and if he (the Holy Prophet)
points with his hand (to wait), then do wait.  The slave-girl did like that.  He (the Holy
Prophet) pointed out with his hand and she got aside and waited, and when he had
finished (the prayer) he said: Daughter of Abu Umayya. you have asked about the two
rak'ahs after the 'Asr prayer.  Some people of 'Abu al-Qais came to me for embracing

number of Muslims to attend larger congregations in the mosques in an atmosphere of
 religions piety.  Apart from prayer, sermon has also been made an integral part of the
