When Abdullah ibn Abbas came to Basrah, people narrated to him 
traditions from AbuMusa.  Therefore Ibn Abbas wrote to him asking 
him about certain things.  In reply AbuMusa wrote to him saying: 
One day I was in the company of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him).  
He wanted to urinate.  Then he came to a soft ground at the foot of a 
wall and urinated.  He (the Prophet) then said: If any of you wants 
to urinate, he should look for a place (like this) for his urination.

I was the leader of the delegation of Banu al-Muntafiq or (the

that came to the Messenger of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). When we 
reached the Prophet, we did not find him in his house. We found 
there Aisha, the Mother of the Believers. She ordered that a dish 
called Khazirah should be prepared for us. It was then prepared. A 
tray containing dates was then presented to us. (The narrator 
Qutaybah did not mention the word qina', tray).

Then the Messenger of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) came. He asked: 
Has anything been served to you or ordered for you?  We replied: 
Yes, Messenger of Allah. While we were sitting in the company of 
the Messenger of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) we suddenly saw that a 
shepherd was driving a herd of sheep to their fold. He had with 
him a newly-born lamb that was crying. 
<p>
He (the Prophet) asked him: What did it bear, O so and so? He 
replied: A ewe. He then said: Slaughter for us in its place a sheep. 
Do not think that we are slaughtering it for you. We have one hundred 
sheep and we do not want their number to increase. Whenever a ewe is 
born, we slaughter a sheep in its place. 
<p>
(The narrator says that the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) used the word 
la tahsabanna, do not think). 
<p>
I (the narrator Laqit) then said: Messenger of Allah, I have a wife 
who has something (wrong) in her tongue, i.e. she is insolent. He 
said: Then divorce her. I said: Messenger of Allah, she had company 
with me and I have children from her. He said: Then ask her (to obey 
you). If there is something good in her, she will do so (obey); and 
do not beat your wife as you beat your slave-girl.

(peace_be_upon_him) and complained to him about the flowing of
(her) blood. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said to
her: That is only (due to) a vein: look, when your menstruation
comes, do not pray; and when your menstruation ends, wash yourself
and then offer prayer during the period from one menstruation to another.

Narrated Hamnah daughter of Jahsh:
<p>
Hamnah said my menstruation was great in quantity and severe. So I
came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) for a decision and
told him. I found him in the house of my sister, Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh.  
<p>
I said: Apostle of Allah, I am a woman who menstruates in great
quantity and it is severe, so what do you think about it? It has
prevented me from praying and fasting.  
<p>
He said: I suggest that you should use cotton, for it absorbs the
blood.  She replied: It is too copious for that.  He said: Then take
a cloth.  She replied: It is too copious for that, for my blood keeps
flowing.  The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: I shall give
you two commands; whichever of them you follow, that will be sufficient
for you without the other, but you know best whether you are strong
enough to follow both of them.  
<p>
He added: This is a stroke of the Devil, so observe your menses
for six or seven days, Allah alone knows which it should be; then
wash. And when you see that you are purified and quite clean, pray
during twenty-three or twenty-four days and nights and fast, for
that will be enough for you, and do so every month, just as women
menstruate and are purified at the time of their menstruation and
their purification.  
<p>
But if you are strong enough to delay the noon (Zuhr) prayer and
advance the afternoon ('Asr) prayer, to wash, and then combine the
noon and the afternoon prayer; to delay the sunset prayer and advance
the night prayer, to wash, and then combine the two prayers, do so:
and to wash at dawn, do so: and fast if you are able to do so if possible; 
<p>
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Of the two commands
this is more to my liking.

saddle. By Allah, the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) got down

When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) saw what had happened to

I said: Yes.  He then said: Set yourself right (i.e. tie some cloth

in it, and then wash the blood from the back of the saddle, and then
return to your mount. When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)

And when she died, she left a will to put salt in the water for washing
