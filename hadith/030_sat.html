Narrated Hudhaifah:
<p>
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) stood among us (to give
an address) and he left out nothing that would happen up to the
last hour without telling it. Some remembered it and some forgot,
and these Companions his have known it. When something of it which
I have forgotten happens, I remember it, Just as a man remember's
another's face when he is away and recognises him when he sees him.

<p>
Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:
<p>
When we were sitting with the Apostle of Allah
(peace_be_upon_him), he talked about periods of trial
(fitnahs), mentioning many of them.  
<p>
When he mentioned the one when people should stay in their houses,
some asked him: Apostle of Allah, what is the trial (fitnah) of
staying at home?  
<p>
He replied: It will be flight and plunder. Then will come a test
which is pleasant. Its murkiness is due to the fact that it is
produced by a man from the people of my house, who will assert
that he belongs to me, whereas he does not, for my friends are
only the God-fearing. Then the people will unite under a man who
will be like a hip-bone on a rib. Then there will be the little
black trial which will leave none of this community without giving
him a slap, and when people say that it is finished, it will be
extended. During it a man will be a believer in the morning and
an infidel in the evening, so that the people will be in two camps:
the camp of faith which will contain no hypocrisy, and the camp of
hypocrisy which will contain no faith. When that happens, expect
the Antichrist (Dajjal) that day or the next.

I swear by Allah, I do not know whether my companions have
forgotten or have pretended to forgot. I swear by Allah that
the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) did not omit a leader
of a wrong belief (fitnah)--up to the end of the world--whose
followers reach the number of three hundred and upwards but he
mentioned to us his name, his father's name and the name of

<p>
Narrated Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman:
<p>
Subay' ibn Khalid said: I came to Kufah at the time when Tustar
was conquered. I took some mules from it. When I entered the
mosque (of Kufah), I found there some people of moderate stature,
and among them was a man whom you could recognize when you saw
him that he was from the people of Hijaz.  
<p>
I asked: Who is he?  The people frowned at me and said: Do you
not recognize him? This is Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman, the companion
of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him).  
<p>
Then Hudhayfah said: People used to ask the Apostle of Allah
(peace_be_upon_him) about good, and I used to ask him about
evil. Then the people stared hard at him.  
<p>
He said: I know the reason why you dislike it. I then asked:
Apostle of Allah, will there be evil as there was before, after
this good which Allah has bestowed on us?  
<p>
He replied: Yes.  I asked: Wherein does the protection from it
lie?  He replied: In the sword.  I asked: Apostle of Allah,
what will then happen?  
<p>
He replied: If Allah has on Earth a caliph who flays your back
and takes your property, obey him, otherwise die holding onto
the stump of a tree.  
<p>
I asked: What will come next?  He replied: Then the Antichrist
(Dajjal) will come forth accompanied by a river and fire. He
who falls into his fire will certainly receive his reward, and
have his load taken off him, but he who falls into his river
will have his load retained and his reward taken off him.  
<p>
I then asked: What will come next?  He said: The Last Hour will
come.

The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted
by Khalid al-Yashkuri through a different chain of narrators.
This version adds: I (hudhaifah) asked: Will any be spared
after the use of sword? He replied: There will be a remanant
with specks in its eye and an illusory truce. He then transmitted
 the rest of the tradition. Qatadah applied this to the apostacy
during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr.
<p>
The word aqdha (sing. qadhan) means specks, hudnan means truce

The tradition mentioned above (No. 4232) has also been transmitted
through a different chain of narrators by Nasr ibn Asim al-Laythi
who said: We came to al-Yashkuri with a group of the people of
Banu Layth.  
<p>
He asked: Who are these people?  We replied: Banu Layth. We have
come to you to ask you about the tradition of Hudhayfah. He then
mentioned the tradition and said: I asked: Apostle of Allah, will
there be evil after this good?  
<p>
He replied: There will be trial (fitnah) and evil.  I asked: Apostle
of Allah, will there be good after this evil?  He replied: Learn
the Book of Allah, Hudhayfah, and adhere to its contents. He said
it three times.  
<p>
I asked: Apostle of Allah, will there be good after this evil?
He replied: An illusory truce and a community with specks in
its eye.  I asked: Apostle of Allah, what do you mean by an
illusory community?  
<p>
He replied: The hearts of the people will not return to their
former condition.  I asked: Apostle of Allah, will there be
evil after this good?  He replied: There will be wrong belief
which will blind and deafen men to the truth in which there
will be summoners at the gates of Hell. If you, Hudhayfah, die
adhering to a stump, it will be better for you than following
any of them.

other one. The narrator 'Abd al-Rahman said: I asked: Have you

<p>
Narrated Thawban:
<p>
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Allah, the
Exalted, folded for me the earth, or he said (the narrator
is doubtful): My Lord folded for me the earth, so much so
that I saw its easts and wests (i.e. the extremeties). The
Kingdom of my community will reach as far as the earth was
folded for me. The two treasures, the red and the white, were
bestowed on me. I prayed to my Lord that He may not destroy
my community by a prevailing famine, and not give their
control to an enemy who annihiliates them en masse except
from among themselves. My Lord said to me: Muhammad, if I make
a decision, it is not withdrawn; and I shall not destroy
them by a prevailing famine, and I shall not give their
control to an enemy, except from among themselves, who 
exterminates them en masse, even if they are stormed from all
sides of the earth; only a section of them will destroy
another section, and a section will captivate another section.
I am afraid about my community of those leaders who will lead
astray. When the sword is used among my people, it will not be
withdrawn from them till the Day of Resurrection, and the Last
Hour will not come before the tribes of my people attach
themselves to the polytheists and tribes of my people worship
idols. There will be among my people thirty great liars each
of them assertinf that he is (Allah's) prophet, whereas I am
the Seal of the Prophets after whom (me) there will be no prophet;
and a section of my people will continue to hold to the truth - 
(according to Ibn 'Isa's version: (will continue to dominate) -
the agreed version goes: "and will not be injured by those who
oppose them, till Allah's command comes."

be maintained for seventy years. I asked: Does it mean seventy
years which remain or seventy years which are gone by? He replied:
It means (seventy years) that are gone by.

unlawful blood; when he sheds unlawful blood, he becomes slow and

such life as Allah has made sacred, except for just cause in Surat
al-Furqan.

Narrated Sa'id b. Jubair:
<p>
I asked Ibn 'Abbas (about the verse relating to intentional
homicide in Surat al-Nisa'). He said: When the verse "Those
who invoke not with Allah any other god, nor slay such life
as Allah has made sacred, except for just cause (Qur'an xxv.
68)" was revealed, the polytheists of Mecca said: We have
killed the soul prohibited by Allah, invoked another god
along with Allah for worship, and commited shameful deed. So
Allah revealed the verse "unless he repents, beleives and
works righteous deeds, for Allah will change the evil of such
persons into good. (Qur'an xxv. 70)" This is meant for them.
As regards the verse "If a man kills a beleiver intentionally,
his recompense is Hell (Quran iv. 93)" he said: If a man knows
the command of Islam and intentionally kills a beleiver, his
repentance will not be accepted. I then mentioned it to Mujahid.
He said: Except the one who was ashamed (of his sin).

The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by
Sa'd b. Jubair from Ibn Abbas through a different chain of
narrators. Ibn 'Abbas said: The verse "Those who invoke not
with Allah (Qur'an xxv. 68)" applies to polytheists. He said:
About them another verse, "Say: O my servants who have
transgressed against their souls (Qur'an xxxiv. 53)" was
also revealed.

Apostle of Allah, if this happens to us it will destroy us. The
