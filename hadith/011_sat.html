<p>
Narrated 'Amir b. Sa'd on the authority of his father (sa'd b. Abi Waqqas):
<p>
When he (Sa'd) fell ill at Mecca (according to the version of
Ibn Abi Khalaf) - then the agreed version has: which brought
him near to death - the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)
went to visit him. He said: Apostle of Allah, I have a large
amount of property, and my daughter is my only heir. May I
give two thirds (of my property) as a sadaqah (charity)? He
said: No. He asked: Then a half? He replied: No. He asked: Then
one third? He replied: (you may will away) a third and a third
is a lot. To leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them
poor begging from people. You will not spent anything, seeking
thereby to please Allah, without being rewarded for it, even
the mouthful you give to your wife. I said: Apostle of Allah,
shall I be left behind from immigration (to Medina)? He said:
If you remain behind after me and do good works seeking the
pleasure of Allah, your rank will be raised and degree increased.
Perhaps you will not remain behind, and some people will benifit
from you and others will be harmed by you. He then said: O Allah,
complete the immigration of my Companions and do not turn them
back. But miserable was Sa'd b. Khawlah. The Apostle of Allah
(peace_be_upon_him) lamented on him as he died at Mecca.

orphan with him went and separated his food from his (orphan's)

This fell heavy on them, and they mentioned this to the Apostle

gave its produce as sadaqah to the devoted) to the poor, relatives,
the emancipation of slaves, Allah's path, travellers. The narrator
Bishr added: "and guests". Then the agreed version goes: No son being

for me a document about the religious endowment (waqf) made by 'Umar
al-Khattab: In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This
is what allah's servant 'Umar has written about Thamgh. He narrated the
tradition like the one transmitted by Nafi'. He added: "provided he is
not storing up goods (for himself)." The surplus fruit will be devoted
to the beggar and the deprived. He then went on with the tradition, saying:
If the man in charge of Thamgh wishes to buy a slave for his work for its
fruits (by selling them), he may do so. Mu'iqb penned it and 'Abd Allah b.
al-Arqam witnessed it: In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful.
this is what Allah's servant 'Umar, Commander of the Faithful, directed, in
casesome incident happens to him (i.e. he dies), that Thamgh, Sirmah b.
al-Akwa', the servant who is there, the hundred shares in (the land of)
Khaibar, the servant who is there and the hundred shares which Muhammad
(peace_be_upon_him) had donated to me in the valley (nearly) will remain
in the custody of Hafsah during her life, then the men of opinion from
her family will be in charge of these (endowments), that these will
neither be sold nor purchased, spending (its produce) where they think
(necessary on the beggar, deprived and relatives). There is no harm to
the one in charge (of this endowment) if he eats himself, or feeds, or
buys slaves with it.
