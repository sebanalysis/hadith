<blockquote>
<p>
Narrated Abu al-Darda':
<p>
Kathir ibn Qays said: I was sitting with Abu al-Darda' in the
mosque of Damascus.  
<p>
A man came to him and said: AbudDarda, I have come to you from
the town of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) for a
tradition that I have heard you relate from the Apostle of Allah
(peace_be_upon_him). I have come for no other purpose.  
<p>
He said: I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say:
If anyone travels on a road in search of knowledge, Allah will
cause him to travel on one of the roads of Paradise. The angels
will lower their wings in their great pleasure with one who seeks
knowledge, the inhabitants of the heavens and the Earth and the
fish in the deep waters will ask forgiveness for the learned man.
The superiority of the learned man over the devout is like that of
the moon, on the night when it is full, over the rest of the stars.
The learned are the heirs of the Prophets, and the Prophets leave
neither dinar nor dirham, leaving only knowledge, and he who takes
it takes an abundant portion.

When he was sitting with the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)

(peace_be_upon_him) said: Allah has more knowledge. The Jew said:
It speaks.

The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Whatever the people

mastered it. I would write for him when he wrote (to them), and
read to him when something was written to him.
