Introduction to Partial Translation of Sunan Abu-Dawud

<p>
Sunan Abu-Dawud is a collection of sayings and deeds of Prophet Muhammad
(pbuh) (also known as the <strong>sunnah</strong>).  The <em>reports</em>
of the Prophet's sayings and deeds are called <strong>ahadith</strong>.
Abu-Dawud lived a couple of centuries after the Prophet's death and worked
extremely hard to collect his ahadith.  Each report in his collection was
checked for compatibility with the Qur'an, and the veracity of the chain of
reporters had to be painstakingly established.  Abu-Dawud's collection is
recognized by the overwhelming majority of the Muslim world to be one of
the most authentic collections of the Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh), however
it is also known to contain some weak ahadith (some of which he pointed
out, others which he did not).

<p>
Abu-Dawud (full name Abu-Dawud Sulaiman bin Al-Aash'ath Al-Azdi as-Sijistani) 
was born in 202 A.H. and died in 275 A.H.  He was one of the most widely 
travelled of the scholars of ahadith, going to Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Khurasahn, 
Egypt, Syria, Nishapur, Marv, and other places for the sole purpose of collecting 
ahadith.  His primary interest was in law, hence his collection focuses purely 
on legal ahadith.  From about 50,000 ahadith, he chose 4,800 for inclusion in 
his work based on their superior authenticity.

<p>
It is important to realize, however, that Abu-Dawud's collection is not
complete: there are other scholars who worked as Abu-Dawud did and collected
other reports.
<strong>
<p>
The translation of Sunan Abu-Dawud found here is not complete!  Roughly
half of the collection is missing; only about eighteen of the books are complete;
please take this into account if you cannot find a specific hadith.

<h3>Note for WWW Developers</h3>
<p>
Sunan Abu-Dawud is divided into 36 books on different subjects, each
book containing many ahadith.  The numbering system used by Abu-Dawud is
consecutive and uninterrupted for the entire collection.

<p>
MSA-USC has placed anchors (hyperlinks) for all the ahadith in the
translations presented here.  Prospective developers of Islamic sites may
find it useful to refer to these anchors.  For example, one could use the
anchors to create an 'active' subject index into Sunan Abu-Dawud.

<p>
The format of the anchor names for the translated ahadith in Sunan Abu-Dawud
is very simple:
<p>
<blockquote>
<code>
DDD_DDDD[A]
</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
where <code>D</code> stands for a digit, and <code>[A]</code> means an
optional letter. The first three digits identify the book, and the
remaining digits and letters identify the report number. The format of the
file names (one per book) is:
<blockquote>
<code>
DDD_sat.html
</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
The three digits are the book number, and <code>sat</code> stands for Sunan
Abu-Dawud Translation.  Given the anchor, you can tell which file it is found
in (e.g. 028_4148 is found in 028_sat.html).

<p>
For example, the following snippet of HTML should take you to book 19, 
number 3644:
<blockquote>
<code>
<a href="019_sat.html#019_3644">
&lt;a href="019_sat.html#019_3644"&gt;SAMPLE&lt;/a&gt;
</a>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
We have taken some pains to remove typos, and scanning/format errors
from these files, but it is more than likely that quite a few still
remain.  <em><b>PLEASE SEND US ANY CORRECTIONS OR SUGGESTIONS!</b></em>

<p>
MSA-USC is indebted to Mr. A. Abdullah for donating this collection of
ahadith in electronic format.  The collection may absolutely
<strong>NOT</strong> be copied or used for commercial gain.

<p>
This collection was provided by MSA at University of Southern California. 
<B>IT IS UNDERGOING COMPLETION BY OUR TEAM.</B>
If you have any comments or suggestions, kindly direct your comments to

take positive measures to remedy any errors or ommitions.

<em>Enjoy!</em>
