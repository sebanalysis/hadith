Narrated Abu Hurairah:
<p>
The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: If anyone resorts to a diviner
and believes in what he says (according) to the version of Musa), or
has intercourse with his wife (according to the agreed version) when
she is menstruating, or has intercourse with his wife through her anus,
he has nothing to do with what has been sent down to Muhammad (peace_be_upon_him)
- according to the version of Musaddad.

Narrated Zaid b. Khalid al-Juhani : 
<p> 
The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) led us in the morning
prayer at al-Hudaibiyyah after rain which had fallen during the night,
and when he finished, he turned to the people and said: Do you know what
your Lord has sail? They said: Allah and His Apostle know best. He said:
This morning there were among my servants one who believes in me and one
who disbelieves. The one who said: "We have been given rain by Allah's
grace and mercy" is the one who believes in me and disbelieves in the
star ; but the one who said: "We have been given rain by such and such a
rain star," is the one who dis-believes in in me and believes in the
star.

belly and no hamah. A nomadic Arab asked: How is it that when camels arc
in the sand as if they were gazelles and a mangy camel comes among them
and it gives them mange? He replied: Who infected the first one? Ma'mar,
quoting al-Zuhri, said : A man told me that Abu Hurairah narrated to him
saying that he heard the Prophet (may peace be upon him) say: A diseased
camel should not be brought with a healthy camel to drink water.3323 He

Prophet (may peace be upon him) had said: There is no infection, no
serpent in a hungry belly and no hamah? He replied: I did not transmit
it to you. Al-Zuhri said: Abu Salamah said: He had narrated it and I did
not hear that Abu Hurairah had ever forgotten any tradition except this
one.
