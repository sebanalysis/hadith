to guide him, and I bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah, He is
One, having no partner with Him, and that Muhammad is His Servant and Messenger.

heard the words of soothsayers and the words of magicians, and the words of poets,

I would have got it, or he (the Holy Prophet) said: I intended to get a bunch (out of

had tied, but did not give it food nor set it free to eat the creatures of the earth; and

died.  The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood up and led people in (two
rak'ahs of) prayer with six ruku's and four prostrations.  He commenced (the prayer)
with takbir (Allah-o-Akbar) and then recited and prolonged his recital.  He then bowed
nearly the (length of time) that he stood up.  He then raised his head from the ruku'
and recited but less than the first recital.  He then bowed (to the length of time) that

He stood up and then bowed, observing six ruku's like it, without (completing)
the rak'ah in them, except (this difference) that the first (qiyam of ruku') was longer
than the later one, and the ruku' was nearly (of the same length) as prostration.  He
then moved backward and the rows behind him also moved backward till we reached
the extreme (Abu Bakr said: till he reached near the women) He then moved forward
and the people also moved forward along with him till he stood at his (original) place
(of worship). He then completed the prayer as it was required to complete and the sun
brightened and he said: O people ! verily the sun and the moon are among the signs
of Allah and they do not eclipse at the death of anyone among people (Abu Bakr
said: On the death of any human being).  So when you see anything like it (of the
nature of eclipse), pray till it is bright.  There is nothing which you have been promised
(in the next world) but I have seen it in this prayer of mine.  Hell was brought to me
as you saw me moving back on account of fear lest its heat might affect me; and I

to steal (the belongings) of the pilgrims with his curved staff.  If he (the owner of the

but if he was unaware of that, he would take that away.  I also saw in it (in Hell) the
owner of a cat whom she had tied and did not feed her nor set her free so that she
could eat the creatures of the earth, till the cat died of starvation.  Paradise was brought
to me, and it was on that occasion that you saw me moving forward till I stood at my
place (of worship).  I stretched my hand as I wanted to catch hold of its fruits so that
you may see them.  Then I thought of not doing it.  Nothing which you have been

BOOK RELATING TO THE DEAD

<blockquote>
<p>
A Divine Service is held over the dead body of every Muslim, young or old, even
of infants who have lived only for a few minutes.  A Muslim opens his eyes in the world
with the words of Adhan in his ears in which he is told that he is a moral being having
moral and spiritual responsibilities far more important than the physical needs.  He should
live in the world with a firm belief in the Creator of the Universe as his only Deity.
Then he should spend his life as a sincere and devoted follower of Muhammad (may
peace be upon him), for it is through him that he has received full information about
the Will of God and the Divine Code of life.  It Is also imprinted upon his fresh and
clear mind that prayer elevates the soul of man and herein lies his success in this world
and the world to come.  With this sacred message he is made to start his life.  Both the
paths are shown to him, the path of righteousness and religious piety and the path of
evil and irreligiousness, and then it is left to his discretion to choose the path he likes.
After spending the allotted length of time he is called back to his Master.</p>
<p> 
When the soul leaves the body, preparations are made for bidding him the last
farewell.  He is washed and perfumed and is wrapped in white sheets.  Then the funeral
prayer is observed keeping his dead body in front of the Imam in which God to
requested in congregation to grant him pardon for his minor and major sins, for all his
failings and to wrap him in His Mercy.</p>
<p> 
A Muslim is received in this world with Adhan and lqama and he is given a send-
off with prayer and supplication to Allah for treating him kindly in his heavenly home.
 </p>
<p>
There is neither Adhan nor Iqama in the funeral prayer which has very deep
significance.  It implies that the Adhan and lqama for the funeral prayer had been
pronounced at the time of his birth.  He is thus awakened to the realisation of the fact
that he should spend the whole span of his life with such single-minded devotion as is
found in a worshipper waiting for the commencement of prayer after the Adhan and
Iqama are pronounced.

'Abdullah b. Abu Mulaika reported: I was sitting by the side of Ibn 'Umar,
and we were waiting for the bier of Umm Aban, daughter of 'Uthman, and there was
also 'Amr b. 'Uthman.  In the meanwhile there came Ibn 'Abbas led by a guide.  I
conceive that he was informed of the place of Ibn 'Umar.  So he came till he sat by my
side.  While I was between them (Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn 'Umar) there came the noise (of
wailing) from the house.  Upon this Ibn 'Umar said (that is, he pointed out to 'Amr
that he should stand and forbid them, for): I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace
be upon him) as saying: The dead is punished because of the lamentation of his family.
'Abdullah made it general (what was said for a particular occasion). Ibn 'Abbas
said: When we were with the Commander of the believers, 'Umar b. Khattab, we reached
Baida', and there was a man under the shadow of the tree.  He said to me:  Go and
inform me who is that person.  So I went and (found) that he was Suhaib.  I returned
to him and said: You commanded me to find out for you who that was, and he is
Suhaib.  He (Hadrat 'Umar) said: Command him to see us.  I said: He has family along
with him.  He said: (That is of no account) even if he has family along with him.  So he
(the narrator) told him to see (the Commander of the believers and his party).  When
we came (to Medina), it was before long that the Commander of the believers was
wounded, and Suhaib came weeping and crying: Alas for the brother, alas for the
companion. Upon this 'Umar said: Didn't you know, or didn't you hear, that the
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: "The dead is punished because of the
lamentation of his family " ?  Then 'Abdullah made it general and 'Umar told it of certain
occasions.  So I ('Abdullah b. Abu Mulaika) stood up and went to 'A'isha and told her
what Ibn 'Umar had said.  Upon this she said: I swear by Allah that Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him) never said that dead would be punished because of his
family's lamenting (for him).  What he said was that Allah would increase the punishment
of the unbeliever because of his family's lamenting for him. Verily it is Allah Who
has caused laughter and weeping. No bearer of a burden will bear another's burden.
Ibn Abu Mulaika said that al-Qasim b. Muhammad said that when the words of 'Umar
and Ibn 'Umar were conveyed to 'A'Isha, she said: You have narrated it to me from
those who are neither liar nor those suspected of lying but (sometimes) hearing misleads.

'Abdullah b. Abu Mulaika said: The daughter of 'Uthman b. 'Affan died
in Mecca.  We came to attend her (funeral).  Ibn 'Umar and Ibn 'Abbas were also
present there, and I was sitting between them.  He added: I (first sat) by the side of
one of them, then the other one came and he sat by my side. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar said
to 'Amr b. 'Uthman who was sitting opposite to him: Will you not prevent the people
from lamenting, for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said: "The
dead is punished because of the lamenting of his family for him"?  Ibn 'Abbas then
said that Umar used to say someting of that nature, and then narrated saying: I proceeded 
from Mecca along with 'Umar till we reached al-Baida' and there was a party
of riders under the shade of a tree.  He said (to me): Go and find out who this party is.
I cast a glance and there was Suhaib (in that party).  So I informed him ('Umar) about
it. He said: Call him to me.  So I went back to Suhaib and said: Go and meet the
Commander of the believers.  When 'Umar was wounded, Suhaib came walling: Alas,
for the brother ! alas for the companion ! 'Umar said: O Suhaib, do you wail for me,
whereas the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: "The dead would be
punished on account of the lamentation of the (members of his family)"?  Ibn 'Abbas
said: When 'Umar died I made a mention of it to 'A'isha.  She said: May Allah have
mercy upon 'Umar ! I swear by Allah that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
never said that Allah would punish the believer because of the weeping (of any one of
the members of his family), but he said that Allah would increase the punishment
of the unbeliever because of the weeping of his family over him.  'A'isha said: The
Qur'an is enough for you (when it states): "No bearer of burden will bear another's
burden" (vi. 164).  Thereupon Ibn 'Abbas said: Allah is He Who has caused laughter
and weeping. Ibn Abu Mulaika said: By Allah, Ibn 'Umar said nothing.

Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
one day in the course of his sermon made mention of a person among his Companions
who had died and had been wrapped in a shroud not long (enough to cover his whole
body) and was buried during the night. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon
him) reprimanded (the audience) that a person was buried during the night (in a state
that) funeral prayer could not  be offered (over him by the Messenger of Allah). (And
this is permissible only) when it becomes a dire necessity for a man.  The Apostle of
Allah (may peace be upon him) also said: When any one of you shrouds his brother,
he should shroud him well.

'Anas b. Malik said: I heard the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) say
(while offering prayer on a dead body): O Allah ! forgive him, have mercy upon him.
Give him peace and absolve him.  Receive him with honour and make his grave spacious.
Wash him with water, snow and hail, cleanse him from faults as is cleaned a white
garment from impurity.  Requite him with an abode more excellent than his abode,
with a family better than his family, and with a mate better than his mate, and save
him from the trial of the grave and torment of Hell.  'Auf b. Malik  said: I earnestly
desired that I were the dead person to receive the prayer of the Messenger of Allah
(may peace be upon him) as this dead body had (received).

Muhammad b. Qais said (to the people): Should I not narrate to you (a

and took off his shoes and placed them near his feet, and spread the corner of his shawl
on his bed and then lay down till he thought that I had gone to sleep. He took
hold of his mantle slowly and put on the shoes slowly, and opened the door and went
out and then closed it lightly.  I covered my head, put on my veil and tightened my
waist wrapper, and then went out following his steps till he reached Baqi'. He
stood there and he stood for a long time.  He then lifted his hands three times, and
then returned and I also returned.  He hastened his steps and I also hastened my steps.
He ran and I too ran.  He came (to the house) and I also came (to the house). I, however, 
preceded him and I entered (the house), and as I lay down in the bed, he (the
Holy Prophet) entered the (house), and said: Why is it, O 'A'isha, that you are out
of breath?  I said: There is nothing.  He said: Tell me or the Subtle and the Aware
would inform me.  I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be ransom
for you, and then I told him (the whole story). He said: Was it the darkness (of your
shadow) that I saw in front of me? I said: Yes.  He struck me on the chest which caused
me pain, and then said: Did you think that Allah and His Apostle would deal unjustly
with you?  She said: Whatsoever the people conceal, Allah will know it.  He said: Gabriel
came to me when you saw me.  He called me and he concealed it from you. I responded
to his call, but I too concealed it from you (for he did not come to you), as you were not
fully dressed. I thought that you had gone to sleep, and I did not like to awaken
you, fearing that you may be frightened.  He (Gabriel) said: Your Lord has commanded 
you to go to the inhabitants of Baqi' (to those lying in the graves) and beg pardon
for them.  I said: Messenger of Allah, how should I pray for them (How should I beg
forgiveness for them) ? He said: Say, Peace be upon the inhabitants of this city (graveyard)

who have gone ahead of us, and those who come later on, and we shall, God willing,
