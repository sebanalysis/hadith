teeth for beauty, changing what Allah has created. When a
woman of Banu Asad called Umm Ya'qub, who read the Qur'an (according
to the version of 'Uthman) heard it, she came to him (according

the women who tatoo, those who have themselves tatooed, those

who pluck hair from their faces, and those who make spaces between
their teeth (according to the agreed version), for changing what
Allah has created (according to the version of 'Uthman). He said:
Why should I not curse those whom the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)
has cursed and those who were mentioned in Allah's Book? She said:
I have read it from cover to cover and have not found it. He then
read: I swear by Allah, if you read it, you would have found it.
He then read: What the Apostle has brought you accept, and what he has
forbidden you refrain from it. She said: I find some of these things
in your wife. He said: Enter (the house) and see. She said: I then
entered (the house) and came out. He asked: What did you see? She
said: I did not see (anything). He said: Had it been so, she would not

Narrated Thawban:
<p>
When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) went on a journey, the
last member of his family he saw was Fatimah, and the first he
visited on his return was Fatimah. Once when he returned from an
expedition she had hung up a hair-cloth, or a curtain, at her
door, and adorned al-Hasan and al-Husayn with silver bracelets. So
when he arrived, he did not enter. Thinking that he had been
prevented from entering by what he had seen, she tore down the
curtain, unfastened the bracelets from the boys and cut them off.  
<p>
They went weeping to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), and
when he had taken them from them, he said: Take this to so and so's
family. Thawban. In Medina, these are my family, and I did not like
them to enjoy their good things in the present life. Buy Fatimah a
necklace or asb, Thawban, and two ivory bracelets.
