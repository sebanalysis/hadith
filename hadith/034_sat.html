<p>
Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:
</p>
<p> Qurayzah and Nadir (were two Jewish tribes). An-Nadir were nobler
than Qurayzah. When a man of Qurayzah killed a man of an-Nadir, he would
be killed. But if a man of an-Nadir killed a man of Qurayzah, a hundred
wasq of dates would be paid as blood-money. When Prophethood was
bestowed upon the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), a man of an-Nadir killed
a man of Qurayzah. </p>

<p> They said: Give him to us, we shall kill him. They replied: We have
the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) between you and us. So they came to him.
</p>

<p> Thereupon the following verse was revealed: "If thou judge, judge in
equity between them." "In equity" means life for a life. </p> 

<p> The following verse was then revealed: "Do they seek of a judgment
of (the days) ignorance?" </p>

He asked: Have you some money so that you pay his blood-wit? He said:
No. He said: What is your opinion if I send you so that you ask the
people (for money) and thus collect your blood-wit? He said: No. He
said: Will your masters give you his blood-wit (to pay his relatives)?
He said: No. He said to the man. Take him. So he brought him out to kill

Abu Umamah ibn Sahl said: We were with Uthman when he was besieged in the
house. There was an entrance to the house. He who entered it heard the
speech of those who were in the Bilat. Uthman then entered it. He came
out to us, looking pale. 
</p>
<p>
He said: They are threatening to kill me now. We said: Allah will be
sufficient for you against them, Commander of the Faithful! He asked:
Why kill me? I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: It is
not lawful to kill a man who is a Muslim except for one of the three
reasons: Kufr (disbelief) after accepting Islam, fornication after
marriage, or wrongfully killing someone, for which he may be killed. 
<p>
I swear by Allah, I have not committed fornication before or after the
coming of Islam, nor did I ever want another religion for me instead of
my religion since Allah gave guidance to me, nor have I killed anyone.
So for what reason do you want to kill me?

<p>
Narrated Sa'd ibn Dumayrah al-Aslami ; Dumayrah al-Aslami:
</p>
<p>
Ziyad ibn Sa'd ibn Dumayrah as-Sulami said on the authority of his
father (Sa'd) and his grandfather (Dumayrah) (according to Musa's
version) who were present in the battle of Hunayn with the Apostle of
Allah (peace_be_upon_him): After the advent of Islam, Muhallam ibn
Jaththamah al-Laythi killed a man of Ashja'. 
<p>
That was the first blood-money decided by the Apostle of Allah
(peace_be_upon_him) (for payment). Uyaynah spoke about the killing of
al-Ashja'i, for he belonged to Ghatafan, and al-Aqra' ibn Habis spoke on
behalf of Muhallam, for he belonged to Khunduf. The voices rose high,
and the dispute and noise grew. 
<p> 
So the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Do you not accept
blood-money, Uyaynah? 

<p> 
Uyaynah then said: No, I swear by Allah, until I cause his women to
suffer the same fighting and grief as he caused my women to suffer.
Again the voices rose high, and the dispute and noise grew.

<p> 
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Do you not accept the
blood-money Uyaynah? Uyaynah gave the same reply as before, and a man of
Banu Layth called Mukaytil stood up. He had a weapon and a skin shield
in his hand.


<p> 

He said: I do not find in the beginning of Islam any illustration for
what he has done except the one that "some sheep came on, and those in
the front were shot; hence those in the rear ran away". (The other
example is that) "make a law today and change it." </p> 

<p> 

The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Fifty (camels) here
immediately and fifty when we return to Medina. This happened during
some of his journeys. Muhallam was a tall man of dark complexion. He was
with the people. They continued (to make effort for him) until he was
released. He sat before the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), with
his eyes flowing. 

<p> 

He said: Apostle of Allah! I have done (the act) of which you have been
informed. I repent to Allah, the Exalted, so ask Allah's forgiveness for
me. Apostle of Allah! 

<p> 
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then said: Did you kill him
with your weapon at the beginning of Islam. O Allah! do not forgive
Muhallam. He said these words loudly. 

<p> 
AbuSalamah added: He (Muhallam) then got up while he was wiping his
tears with the end of his garment. 

<p> 
Ibn Ishaq said: His people alleged that the Apostle of Allah
(peace_be_upon_him) asked forgiveness for him after that.

informed me. She said: Yes. He said: What did you intend by it? She
said: I thought if you were a prophet, it would not harm you; if you
were not a prophet, we should rid ourselves of him (i.e. the Prophet).
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then forgave her, and did not
punish her. But some of his companions who ate it, died. The Apostle of
Allah (peace_be_upon_him) had himself cupped on his shoulder on account

Sahl b. Abi Hathmah and some senior men of the tribe told that 'Abd
Allah b. Abi Sahl and Muhayyasah came to Khaibar on account of the
calamity (i.e. famine) that befell them. Muhayyasah came and told that
'Abd Allah b. Sahl had been killed and thrown in a well or a stream. He
then came to the Jews and said: I swear by Allah, you have killed him.
They said: We swear by Allah, we have not kill-ed him. He then proceeded
and came to his tribe and mentioned this to them. Then he, his brother
Huwayyasah, who was older than him, and 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl came
forward (to the Prophet). Muhayyasah began to speak. It was he who was
at Khaibar. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) then said to
him: Let the eldest (speak), let the eldest (speak), meaning age. So
Huwayyasah spoke, and after him Mubayyasah spoke. The Apostle of Allah
(may peace be upon him) then said: They should either pay the bloodwit
for your friend or they should be prepared for war. So the Apostle of
Allah (may peace be upon him) wrote to them about it. They wrote (in

take an oath. They said: They are not Muslims. Then the Apostle of Allah

name for it, but it is called balzilam and bàzil 'âmain, and mukhlif and
mukhlif'amain, up to any year it increases. Nad b. Shumail said: Bint
makhad is a she-camel of one year, and bint labun is a she-camel of two
years, hiqqah is a she-camel of three years, jadha'ah is a she-camel of
four years, thani is a camel of five years, raba' is a camel of six

The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: For each tooth are ten camels.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: I found in my notebook from Shaiban and I did not hear
from him; Abu Bakr, a reliable friend of ours said: Shaiban - Muhammad
b. Rashid - Sulaiman b. Musa - 'Amr b. Shu'aib said that his
grandfather, Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As said: The Apostle of Allah
(peace_be_upon_him) would fix the blood-money for accidental killing at
the rate of four hundred dinars or their equivalent in silver for
townsmen, and he would fix it according to the price of camels. So when
they were dear, he increased the amount to be paid, and when cheap
prices prevailed he reduced the amount to be paid. In the time of the
Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) they reached between four hundred
and eight hundred dinars, their equivalent in silver being eight
thousand dirhams. 
</p>
<p>
He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) gave judgment that
those who possessed cattle should pay two hundred cows, and those who
possessed sheep two thousand sheep. 
</p>
<p>
He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: The blood-money
is to be treated as something to be inherited by the heirs of the one
who has been killed, and the remainder should be divided among the
agnates. 
</p>
<p>
He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) gave judgment that for
cutting off a nose completely there was full blood-money, one hundred
(camels) were to be paid. If the tip of the nose was cut off, half of
the blood-money,i.e. fifty camels were to be paid, or their equivalent
in gold or in silver, or a hundred cows, or one thousand sheep. For the
hand, when it was cut of,f half of the blood-money was to be paid; for
one foot of half, the blood-money was to be paid. For a wound in the
head, a third of the blood-money was due, i.e. thirty-three camels and a
third of the blood-money, or their equivalent in gold, silver, cows or
sheep. For a head thrust which reaches the body, the same blood-money
was to be paid. Ten camels were to be paid for every finger, and five
camels for every tooth. 
</p>
<p>
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) gave judgment that the
blood-money for a woman should be divided among her relatives on her
father's side, who did not inherit anything from her except the
residence of her heirs. If she was killed, her blood-money should be
distributed among her heirs, and they would have the right of taking
revenge on the murderer. 
</p>
<p>
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: There is nothing for the
murderer; and if he (the victim) has no heir, his heir will be the one
who is nearest to him among the people, but the murderer should not
inherit anything.

Narrated Abu Hurairah:
</p>
<p>
The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: No retaliation is
payable for a wound caused by a dumb animal, for a mine, and for a well.
On the treasure found buried in the land there is a fifth.
<p>
Abu Dawud said : A dumb animal means an animal which is free and has no
tether, and there is no one (as a watchman) with it. It causes harm by
day and not by night.

<blockquote>
<p>
Narrated Anas b. Malik :
</p>
<p>
Al-Rubayyi', sister of Anas b. al-Nadr, broke (one of) the front teeth
of a woman. They came to the Prophet (may peace be upon him). He made a
decision in accordance with the Book of Allah that retaliation should be
taken. Anas b. al-Nadr said: I swear by Him Who has sent you with truth,
her front tooth will not be broken today. He replied: Anas! Allah's
decree is retaliation. flut the people were agreeable to accepting a
fine, so the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) said : Among
Allah's servants there are those who, if they adjured Allah, He (Allah)
would consent to it.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say: He was asked: How
retaliation of a tooth is taken? He said: It is broken with a file.
