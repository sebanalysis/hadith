Introduction to Translation of Malik's Muwatta
</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>
Malik's Muwatta ("the well-trodden path") is a collection of two items:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the sayings and deeds of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) (also known as the
<strong>sunnah</strong>). The <em>reports</em> of the Prophet's sayings and
deeds are called <strong>ahadith</strong>.
<li>the legal opinions and decisions of the Prophet's Companions, their
successors, and some later authorities.
</ul>

<p>
Malik (full name Malik bin Anas bin Malik bin Abu Amir Al-Asbahi) was born
in 93 A.H. and died in 179 A.H.  He lived most of his life in Madinah, the
city in which the Prophet (pbuh) settled in.  He was a preeminent scholar
of Islam, and is the originator of the Maliki judicial school of thought.
He is reputed to have had over one thousand students.  During Malik's
lifetime, he steadily revised his Muwatta, so it reflects over forty years
of his learning and knowledge.  It contains a few thousand hadith.
</p>

<p>
It is important to realize, however, that Malik's collection is not
complete: there are other scholars who worked as Malik did and collected
other reports.
</p>

<h3>Note for WWW Developers</h3>

<p>
Malik's Muwatta is divided into 61 books on different subjects, each
book containing many ahadith.  The numbering system used by Malik is
consecutive per book.
</p>

<p>
MSA-USC has placed anchors (hyperlinks) for all the ahadith in the
translations presented here.  Prospective developers of Islamic sites may
find it useful to refer to these anchors.  For example, one could use the
anchors to create an 'active' subject index into the Muwatta.
</p>

<p>
The format of the anchor names for the translated ahadith in Malik's Muwatta 
is very simple:
<blockquote>
<code>
DDD.N.N.N
</code>
</blockquote>
where <code>D</code> stands for a digit, and <code>N</code> is a number of
(several) digits. The first three digits identify the book, and the
remaining numbers identify the report number. The format of the file names
(one per book) is:
<blockquote>
<code>
DDD_mmt.html
</code>
</blockquote>
The three digits are the book number, and <code>mmt</code> stands for Malik's
Muwatta Translation.  Given the anchor, you can tell which file it is found
in (e.g. 043.43.7.5 is found in 043_mmt.html).
</p>

<p>
For example, the following snippet of HTML should take you to book 28, 
number 28.20.46:
<blockquote>
<code>
<a href="028_mmt.html#028.28.20.46">
&lt;a href="028_mmt.html#028.28.20.46"&gt;SAMPLE&lt;/a&gt;
</a>
</code>
</blockquote>

We have taken some pains to remove typos, and scanning/format errors
from these files, but it is more than likely that quite a few still
remain.  <em>PLEASE SEND US ANY CORRECTIONS OR SUGGESTIONS!</em>
