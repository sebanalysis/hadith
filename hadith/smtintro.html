Introduction to Translation of Sahih Muslim
</h1>
<p align=center>
<em>Translator: Abdul Hamid Siddiqui</em>

<blockquote>
<p>
Sahih Muslim is a collection of sayings and deeds of Prophet Muhammad
(pbuh) (also known as the <strong>sunnah</strong>).  The <em>reports</em>
of the Prophet's sayings and deeds are called <strong>ahadith</strong>.
Muslim lived a couple of centuries after the Prophet's death and worked
extremely hard to collect his ahadith.  Each report in his collection was
checked for compatibility with the Qur'an, and the veracity of the chain of
reporters had to be painstakingly established.  Muslim's collection is
recognized by the overwhelming majority of the Muslim world to be one of
the most authentic collections of the Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh).
</p>

<p>
Muslim (full name Abul Husain Muslim bin al-Hajjaj al-Nisapuri) was born in
202 A.H. and died in 261 A.H.  He travelled widely to gather his collection
of ahadith, including to Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Egypt.  Out of
300,000 ahadith which he evaluated, only 4,000 approximately (including 
multiple hadith in a single one i.e. multiple quotations) were extracted
for inclusion into his collection based on stringent acceptance criteria.
Muslim was a student of <a href="https://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/bukhari/bukhari.html">Bukhari</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is important to realize, however, that Muslim's collection is not
complete: there are other scholars who worked as Muslim did and collected
other authentic reports.
</p>

<strong>
<p>
The translation of Sahih Muslim found here is complete!

<h3>Note for WWW Developers</h3>

<p>
Sahih Muslim is divided into 43 books on different subjects, each
book containing many ahadith.  The numbering system used by Muslim is
consecutive and uninterrupted for the entire collection.
</p>

<p>
DEED-IIU has placed anchors (hyperlinks) for all the ahadith in the
translations presented here.  Prospective developers of Islamic sites may
find it useful to refer to these anchors.  For example, one could use the
anchors to create an 'active' subject index into Sahih Muslim.
</p>

<p>
The format of the anchor names for the translated ahadith in Sahih Muslim 
is very simple (one of two forms):
<blockquote>
<code>
DDD_DDDD[A]<br>
DDD_DDDD[.D]
</code>
</blockquote>
where <code>D</code> stands for a digit, <code>[A]</code> means an optional
letter, and <code>[.D]</code> means an optional period followed by a digit.
The first three digits are the book number, and the remaining digits and
letters identify the report number.  The format of the file names (one per
book) is:
<blockquote>
<code>
DDD_smt.html
</code>
</blockquote>
The three digits are the book number, and <code>smt</code> stands for Sahih
Muslim Translation.  Given the anchor, you can tell which file it is found
in (e.g. 005_2134 is found in 005_smt.html).
</p>

<p>
For example, the following snippet of HTML should take you to book 2, 
number 432:
<blockquote>
<code>
<a href="002_smt.html#002_0432">
&lt;a href="002_smt.html#002_0432"&gt;SAMPLE&lt;/a&gt;
</a>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
We have taken some pains to remove typing and scanning/format errors
from these files, but it is more than likely that quite a few still
remain.  <em>PLEASE SEND US ANY CORRECTIONS OR SUGGESTIONS!</em>
</p>

<p>
The whole of this hadith database was converted to electronic form 
by the DEED-IIU group after we saw the dedicated work done by Muslim 
Students Association at University of South California.  The collection
may absolutely <strong>NOT</strong> be copied or used for commercial
gain.
