Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:
</p>



<p>

The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: He who swears an oath in which he tells a lie to take the property of a Muslim by unfair means, will meet Allah while He is angry with him.  
</p>


<p>

Al-Ash'ath said: I swear by Allah, he said this about me. There was some land between me and a Jew, but he denied it to me; so I presented him to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him).  
</p>


<p>

The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) asked me: Have you any evidence?  I replied: No.  He said to the Jew: Take an oath.  I said: Apostle of Allah, now he will take an oath and take my property.  So Allah, the Exalted, revealed the verse, "As for those who sell the faith they owe to Allah and their own plighted word for a small price, they shall have no portion in the hereafter."

</p>



<p>

A man of Kindah and a man of Hadramawt brought their dispute to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) about a land in the Yemen. Al-Hadrami said: Apostle of Allah, the father of this (man) usurped my land and it is in his possession. 
</p>


<p>

The Prophet asked: Have you any evidence? 
</p>


<p>

Al-Hadrami replied: No, but I make him swear (that he should say) that he does not know that it is my land which his father usurped from me. 
</p>


<p>

Al-Kindi became ready to take the oath. 
</p>


<p>

The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: If anyone usurps the property by taking an oath, he will meet Allah while his hand is mutilated. 
</p>


<p>

Al-Kindi then said: It is his land.
