Narrated Abu Sa'id al-Khudri:
<p>
When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) put on a new garment
he mentioned it by name, turban or shirt, and would then say: O
Allah, praise be to Thee! as Thou hast clothed me with it, I ask
Thee for its good and the good of that for which it was made, and
I seek refuge in Thee from its evil and the evil of that for which
it was made.
<p>
Abu Nadrah said: When any of the Companions of the Prophet (may peace be
upon him) put on a new garment, he was told: May you wear it out and may
Allah give you another in its place.

Narrated Sahl Ibn al-Hanzaliyyah:
<p>
Qays ibn Bishr at-Taghlibi said: My father told me that he was
a companion of Abu al-Darda'. There was in Damascus a man from
the companions of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), called Ibn
al-Hanzaliyyah. He was a recluse and rarely met the people. He
remained engaged in prayer. When he was not praying he was
occupied in glorifying Allah and exalting Him until he went to
his family. Once he passed us when we were with Abu al-Darda'.  
<p>
Abu al-Darda' said to him: Tell us a word which benefits us and
does not harm you.  
<p>
He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) sent out a
contingent and it came back. One of the men came and sat in
the place where the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used
to sit, and he said to a man beside him: Would that you saw us
when we met the enemy and so-and-so attacked and cut through a
lance.  
<p>
He said: Take it from me and I am a boy of the tribe Ghifar. What
do you think about his statement?  
<p>
He replied: I think his reward was lost.  Another man heard it
and said: I do not think that there is any harm in it.  They
quarrelled until the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) heard
it, and he said: Glory be to Allah! There is no harm if he is
rewarded and praised. I saw that Abu al-Darda' was pleased with it
and began to raise his hand to him and say: Did you hear it from
the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)?  
<p>
He said: Yes. He continued to repeat it to him so often that I
thought he was going to kneel down. He said: On another day he
again passed us.  
<p>
Abu al-Darda' said to him: (Tell us) a word which benefits us and
does not harm you.  
<p>
He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said to us:
One who spends on (the maintenance of) horses (for jihad) is
like the one who spreads his hand to give alms (sadaqah) and
does not withhold it. He then passed us on another day.  
<p>
Abu al-Darda' said to him: (Tell us) a word which benefits us and
does no harm to you.

He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Khuraym
al-Asadi would be a fine man were it not for the length of his
hair, which reaches the shoulders, and the way he lets his lower
garment hang down. When Khuraym heard that, he hurriedly, took
a knife, cut his hair in line with his ears and raised his lower
garment half way up his legs. He then passed us on another day.  
<p>
Abu al-Darda' said to him: (tell us) a word which benefits us and
does not harm you.  
<p>
He said: I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: You

like obscene words or deeds, or do intentional committing of

I was with the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) while
Maymunah was with him. Then Ibn Umm Maktum came. This
happened when we were ordered to observe veil (purdah).
The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Observe veil from
him. We asked: Apostle of Allah! is he not blind? He can
neither see us nor recognise us. The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him)
said: Are both of you blind? Do you not see him? 
<p>
Abu Dawud said: This was peculiar to the wives of the
Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). Do you not see that Fatimah
daughter of Qays passed her waiting period with Ibn Umm
Maktum. The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said to Fatimah
daughter of Qays: Pass your waiting period with Ibn Umm

Narrated Abu Hurairah:
<p>
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Gabriel
(peace_be_upon_him) came to me and said: I came to you last
night and was prevented from entering simply because there
were images at the door, for there was a decorated curtain
with images on it in the house, and there was a dog in the
house. So order the head of the image which is in the house
to be cut off so that it resembles the form of a tree; order
the curtain to be cut up and made into two cushions spread
out on which people may tread; and order the dog to be turned out.  
<p>
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then did so. The dog
belonged to al-Hasan or al-Husayn and was under their couch.
So he ordered it to be turned out.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: Al-Nadd means a thing on which clothes are
placed like a couch.
