<p>
Narrated Jabir ibn Samurah:
<p>
The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: The religion will continue
to be established till there are twelve caliphs over you, and the
whole community will agree on each of them. I then heard from the
Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) some remarks which I could not understand.
I asked my father: What is he saying: He said: all of them will
belong to Quraysh.

<p>
Narrated Jabir ibn Samurah:
<p>
I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: This religion
will continue to be strong till the time of the twelve caliphs. The
people then uttered: Allah is most great, and uproared. He then silently
spoke a word which I could not understand. So I said to my father:
What did he say, father? He said: All of them will belong to Quraish.

Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:
<p>
The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: If only one day of this world
remained. Allah would lengthen that day (according to the version
of Za'idah), till He raised up in it a man who belongs to me or to
my family whose father's name is the same as my father's, who will
fill the earth with equity and justice as it has been filled with
oppression and tyranny (according to the version of Fitr). Sufyan's
version says: The world will not pass away before the Arabs are ruled
by a man of my family whose name will be the same as mine.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: The version of 'Umar and Abu Bakr is the same as that
of Sufyan.

<p>
Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:
<p>
The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Disagreement will occur at
the death of a caliph and a man of the people of Medina will come
flying forth to Mecca. Some of the people of Mecca will come to
him, bring him out against his will and swear allegiance to him
between the Corner and the Maqam. An expeditionary force will then
be sent against him from Syria but will be swallowed up in the desert
between Mecca and Medina. When the people see that, the eminent saints
of Syria and the best people of Iraq will come to him and swear
allegiance to him between the Corner and the Maqam.  
<p>
Then there will arise a man of Quraysh whose maternal uncles belong
to Kalb and send against them an expeditionary force which will be
overcome by them, and that is the expedition of Kalb. Disappointed
will be the one who does not receive the booty of Kalb. He will divide
the property, and will govern the people by the Sunnah of their Prophet
(peace_be_upon_him) and establish Islam on Earth. He will remain seven
years, then die, and the Muslims will pray over him.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: Some transmitted from Hisham "nine years" and some
"seven years."

The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said about the swallowing up of an army
by the earth. I asked: How will a man who comes against his will (be
swallowed up by the earth), Apostle of Allah? He replied: All will be
swallowed up, but each will be raised according to his intention on the
Day of Resurrection.
<p>
Narrated Ali ibn Abu Talib:
<p>
Abu Ishaq told that Ali looked at his son al-Hasan and said: This son
of mine is a sayyid (chief) as named by the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him),

of your Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and resemble him in conduct but not
in appearance. He then mentioned the story about his filling the earth
with justice.

for Muhammad's family as Quraysh consolidated them for the Apostle
of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). Every believer must help him, or he
said: respond to his sermons.
