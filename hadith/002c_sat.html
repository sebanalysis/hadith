<blockquote>
<p>
Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:
<p>
In Surat al-Muzzammil (73), the verse: "Keep vigil at night but a 
little, a half thereof" (2-3) has been abrogated by the following 
verse: "He knoweth that ye count it not, and turneth unto you in 
mercy. Recite then of the Qur'an that which is easy for you" (v.20). 
The phrase "the vigil of the night" (nashi'at al-layl) means the 
early hours of the night. They (the companions) would pray (the 
tahajjud prayer) in the early hours of the night.  
<p>
He (Ibn Abbas) says: It is advisable to offer the prayer at night 
(tahajjud), prescribed by Allah for you (in the early hours of the 
night). This is because when a person sleeps, he does not know when 
he will awake. The words "speech more certain" (aqwamu qilan) means 
that this time is more suitable for the understanding of the Qur'an. 
He says: The verse: "Lo, thou hast by day a chain of business" (v.7) 
means engagement for long periods (in the day's work).

Narrated Sa'd b. Hisham:
<p>
I divorced my wife. I then came to Medina to sell my land that
was there so that I could buy arms and fight in battle. I met
a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him).
They said: Six persons of us intended to do so (i.e. to divorce
their wives and purchase weapons), but the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him)
prohibited them. He said: For you in the Apostle of Allah 
(peace_be_upon_him) there is an excellent model. I then came to
Ibn 'Abbas and asked him about the witr observed by the Prophet 
(peace_be_upon_him). He said: I point to you a person who is most
familiar witr prayer observed by the Apostle of Allah 
(peace_be_upon_him). Go to 'A'ishah. While going to her I asked
Hakim b. Aflah to accompany me. He refused, but I adjured him. He,
therefore, went along with me. We sought permission to enter upon
'A'ishah. She said: Who is this? He said: Hakim b. Aflah. She asked:
Who is with you? He replied: Sa'd b. Hisham. She said: Hisham son of
'Amir who was killed in the Battle of Uhad. I said: Yes. She said: What
a good man 'Amir was! I said: Mother of the faithful, tell me about the
character of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). She asked: Do
you not recite the Qur'an? The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)
was the Qur'an. I asked: Tell me about his vigil and prayer at night.
She replied: Do you not recite: "O thou folded in garmamemts" (lxxiii. 1)
I said: Why not?
<p
When the opening verses of this surah were revealed, the Companions
stood praying (most of the night) until their feet swelled; and the
concluding verses were not revealed for twelve months fro the heaven.
At last the concluding verses were revealed and so prayer at the night
became voluntary after it was obligatory. I said: Tell me about witr
of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). She replied: He used to pray
eight rak'ahs, sitting only during the eighth of them. Then he would
stand up and pray another rak'ah. He would sit only after the eighth
and the ninth rak'ah. He would then pray two rak'ahs sitting, and that
made eleven rak'ahs, sonny. But when he grew old and became fleshy he
observed a witr of seven, sitting only in the sixth and the seventh 
ra'kahs, and would utter salutation only after the seventh rak'ah. He
would then pray two rak'ahs sitting, and that made nine rak'ahs, sonny. 
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) would not pray through the 
whole night, or recite the whole Qur'an in a night, or fast a complete
month except Ramadhan. When he offered a prayer, he would so that
regularly. When he was overtaken by sleep at night, he would pray
twelve rak'ahs.
<p>
The narrator said: I came to Ibn 'Abbas and narrated all this to him.
By Allah, this is really a traditio. Had I been on speaking terms with
her, I would not have come to hear it from her mouth. I said: If I knew 
that you were not on speaking terms with her, I would have never narrated
it to you.

Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
<p>
Zurarah ibn Awfa said that Aisha was asked about the midnight prayer of 
the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him).  
</p>
<p>
She said: He used to offer his night prayer in congregation and then 
return to his family (in his house) and pray four rak'ahs. Then he 
would go to his bed and sleep, but the water for his ablution was placed 
covered near his head and his tooth-stick was also kept there until 
Allah awakened him at night.  
</p>
<p>
He then used the tooth-stick, performed ablution perfectly then 
came to the place of prayer and would pray eight rak'ahs, in which 
he would recite Surah al-Fatihah, and a surah from the Qur'an as 
Allah willed. He would not sit during any of them but sit after 
the eighth rak'ah, and would not utter the salutation, but recite 
(the Qur'an) during the ninth rak'ah. Then he would sit and supplicate 
as long as Allah willed, and beg Him and devote his attention to Him; 
He would utter the salutation once in such a loud voice that the 
inmates of the house were almost awakened by his loud salutation. 
He would then recite Surah al-Fatihah while sitting, bow while sitting, 
and then recite the Qur'an during the second rak'ah, and would bow and 
prostrate while sitting. He would supplicate Allah as long as He willed, 
then utter the salutation and turn away.  
</p>
<p>
This amount of prayer of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) 
continued till he put a weight. During that period he retrenched 
two rak'ahs from nine and began to pray six and seven rak'ahs 
standing and two rak'ahs sitting. This continued till he died.
