that those who are infidels may afflict you" (iv. 101), whereas those
days are gone now? He replied: I have wondered about the same matter
for which you wondered. So I mentioned this to the Apostle of Allah
(peace_be_upon_him). He said: It is an act of charity which Allah has
done to you, so accept His charity.

the noon prayer.

Thereupon, the unbelievers said: We suffered from negligence; we
became careless. We should have attacked them while they were praying.
Thereupon the verse was revealed, relating to the shortening of the
prayer (in time of danger) between the noon and afternoon (prayer).  
<p>
When the time of the afternoon prayer came, the Apostle of Allah
(peace_be_upon_him) stood facing the qiblah, and the unbelievers
were standing in front of him. The people stood in a row behind
the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and there was another
row behind this row. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) bowed
and all of them bowed. He then prostrated and also the row near him
prostrated. The other people in the second row remained standing and
stood guard over them. When they performed two prostrations and stood
up, those who were behind them prostrated. The people in the front
row near him then stepped backward taking the place of the people in
the second row and the second row took the place of the first row.

near him (i.e. the front row) were seated, the people in the second
row behind them prostrated themselves. Then all of them were seated.

The prayer in the time of danger should be offered in the following way:
The imam should stand (for prayer) and a section of the person should
stand along with him. The other section should stand facing the enemy.
The imam should perform bowing and prostrate himself along with those who
are with him. He then should stand (after prostration)and, when he stands
straight, he should remain standing. They (the people) should (in the meantime)
complete their remaining rak'ah (i.e. the second one). Then they should

the other was standing before the enemy, and their backs were
towards the qiblah. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)

'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas, Abd al-Rahman b. Azhar and al-Miswar b. Makhramah
sent him to 'A'ishah, wife of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). They said:
Convey our regards to her from all of us and ask her about the two rak'ahs
after the afternoon prayer; and tell her that we have been informed that
she prays them; and we are told that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)
prohibited them. I entered upon her and told her that for which they had sent
me. She said: Ask Umm Salamah. I returned to them Ibn 'Abbas and others) and
informed them about her opinion. They sent me back to Umm Salamah with the same
mission for which they had sent me to 'A'ishah. Umm Salamah said: I heard the
Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) prohibiting them, but I later on saw him
praying them. When he prayed them, he had offered the afternoon prayer. He then
came to me while a number of woman from Banu Haram from the Ansar were sitting
with me. He prayed these two rak'ahs. I sent a slave girl to him and I told
her: Stand beside him and tell him that Umm Salamah has asked:  Apostle of Allah,
I heard you prohibiting these two rak'ahs (after the afternoon prayer) but I see
you praying them yourself. If he makes a sign with his hand, step backwards
from him. The slave-girl did so. He (the Prophet) made a sign with his hand; she
turned away from him. When he finished his prayer, he said: O daughter of Abu
Ummayah, you asked about praying of two rak'ahs after the afternoon prayer; in
fact, some people of 'Abd al-Qais had come to me with the news their people
had embraced Islam. They hindered me from praying the two rak'ahs after the
afternoon prayer. It is those two rak'ahs (which I offered after the afternoon
prayer).

the dawn prayer; then stop praying when the sun is rising till it
has reached the height of one or two lances, for it rises between
the two horns of the Devil, and the infidels offer prayer for it

These are the ten things: you should pray four rak'ahs, reciting

it ten times while bowing. Then you should raise your head after
bowing and say it ten times. Then you should kneel down in prostration

prostrate yourself and say it ten times. Then you should raise your
