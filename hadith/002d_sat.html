<p>
Narrated Abu Hurairah:
</p>
<p>
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used to commend prayers at
night during Ramadhan, but did not command it as a duty. He would
said: If anyone prays during the night in Ramadhan because of faith and
seeking his reward from Allah, his previous sinswould be forgiven to
him. When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) died, this was the 
practice, and it continued thus during the Abu Bakr's caliphate and
early part of 'Umars.

of power(lailat-ul-qadr) because of faith and and in order to seek his
reward from Allah, his previous sinswould be forgiven to him.

Abu Dawud said: this tradition has been transmitted in a simmilar

</p>
<p>
The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) offered (tarawih) prayer in the 
mosque and the people also prayed with him. He then prayed the
following night, and the people gathered in large numbers. They
gathered on the third night too, but the Apostle of Allah 
(peace_be_upon_him) did not come out to them. When the morning came, 
he said: I witnessed what you did, and nothing prevented me from
comming out to you except that I feared thet this (prayer) might
be prescribed for you. That was in Ramadhan.

did your position remain hidden from me.

</p>
<p>
We fasted with the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) during Ramadan,
but he did not make us get up at night for prayer at any time during the
month till seven nights remained; then he made us get up for prayer till
a third of the night had passed. When the sixth remaining night came, he
did not make us get up for prayer. When the fifth remaining night came,
he made us stand in prayer till a half of the night had gone.  
</p>
<p>
So I said: Apostle of Allah, I wish you had led us in supererogatory 
prayers during the whole of tonight.  
</p>
<p>
He said: When a man prays with an imam till he goes he is reckoned as
having spent a whole night in prayer. On the fourth remaining night he
did not make us get up. When the third remaining night came, he gathered
his family, his wives, and the people and prayed with us till we were
afraid we should miss the falah (success).  
</p>
<p>
I said: What is falah?  He said: The meal before daybreak. Then he did
not make us get up for prayer during the remainder of the month.

<p>
Narrated Zirr (b. Hubaish):
<p>
I said to Ubayy b. K'ab: Tell me about lailat al-qadr, O Abu
al-Mundhir, for our companion (Ibn Mas'ud) was questioned about
it, and he said: Anyone who gets up for prayer every night all
the year round will hit upon it (i.e. lailat al-qadr). He
replied: May Allah have mercy on Abu 'Abd al-Rahman. By Allah
he knew that it was in Ramadhan, (Musaddad's version goes) but
he disliked that the people should content themselves (with that
night alone); or the people should not content themselves (with that
night alone). According to the agreed version: By Allah, it is the 
twenty-seventh night of Ramadhan, without any reservation. I said: 
How do you know that, Abu al-Mundhir? He replied: By the indication
(or sign) of which the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) informed
us. I asked Zirr: What is that sign? He replied: The sun rises like 
a vessel of water in the morning following that night; it has no
ray until it rises high up.

They (the people) said: Who will ask the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)

usual); when the twenty-first night came, and this is the night
when he used to come out of his devotion in the mosque, he said:
He who engaged himself in devotion along with me should do so 
during the last ten days; I saw that night, then was caused to forget
it, but I have seen myself prostrating in water and mud on the morning
following (that night), so seek it in the last ten days and seek it in
every night with an odd number. Abu Sa'id said: Rain fell that night,
the mosque that was a thached building dripped, and my eyes saw the 
Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) with traces of water and mud, on
his forehead on the morning following the twenty-first night.
