Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab: </p> 

<p> 
`Umar said: The prohibition of wine came down when (the Qur'anic verse)
came down. It was made from five things, namely, grapes, dates, honey,
wheat, barley. Wine (khamr) is what infects (khamara) the mind. There
are three things I wished that the Prophet (may peace be upon him) would
not leave us until he explained them fully to our satisfaction: (share
of) grandfather, one who leaves no descendants or ascendants as heirs,
and the details of usury.

<p> When the prohibition of wine (was yet to be) declared, Umar said: O
Allah, give us a satisfactory explanation about wine. </p> 

<p> So the following verse of Surat al-Baqarah revealed; "They ask thee
concerning wine and gambling. Say: In them is great sin...." Umar was
then called and it was recited to him. </p> 

<p> He said: O Allah, give us a satisfactory explanation about wine.
</p> 

<p> Then the following verse of Surat an-Nisa' was revealed: "O ye who
believe! approach not prayers with a mind befogged...." Thereafter the
herald of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) would call when the
(congregational) prayer was performed: Beware, one who is drunk should
not come to prayer. Umar was again called and it was recited to him).

<p> He said: O Allah, give us a satisfactory explanation about wine.
This verse was revealed: "Will ye not then abstain?" Umar said: We

'A'ishah said that the Prophet (may peace be upon him) used to stay with
Zainab, daughter of Jahsh, and drink honey. I and Hafsah counselled each
other that if the Prophet (may peace be upon him) enters upon any of us,
she must say: [find the smell of gum (maghafir) from you. He then
entered upon one of them; she said that to him. Thereupon he said: No, I
drank honey at (the house of) Zainab daughter of Jahsh, and I will not
do it again. Then the following verse came down: "O Prophet! why holdest
thou to be forbidden that which Allah has made lawful to thee ? "Thou
seekest.. . . If you two turn in repentance to Allah" refers to Hafsah
and 'A'ishah, and the verse: "When the Prophet disclosed a matter in
confidence to one of his consorts" refers to the statement of the
Prophet (may peace be upon him): No, I drank honey.
