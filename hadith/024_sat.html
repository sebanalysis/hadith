<p> 
Juwayriyyah, daughter of al-Harith ibn al-Mustaliq, fell to the lot of
Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shammas, or to her cousin. She entered into an
agreement to purchase her freedom. She was a very beautiful woman, most
attractive to the eye. 
<p> 
Aisha said: She then came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)
asking him for the purchase of her freedom. When she was standing at the
door, I looked at her with disapproval. I realised that the Apostle of
Allah (peace_be_upon_him) would look at her in the same way that I had
looked. 
<p> 
She said: Apostle of Allah, I am Juwayriyyah, daughter of al-Harith, and
something has happened to me, which is not hidden from you. I have
fallen to the lot of Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shammas, and I have entered
into an agreement to purchase of my freedom. I have come to you to seek
assistance for the purchase of my freedom. 
<p> 
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Are you inclined to that
which is better? She asked: What is that, Apostle of Allah? He replied:
I shall pay the price of your freedom on your behalf, and I shall marry
you. 
<p> 
She said: I shall do this. She (Aisha) said: The people then heard that
the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) had married Juwayriyyah. They
released the captives in their possession and set them free, and said:
They are the relatives of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) by
marriage. We did not see any woman greater than Juwayriyyah who brought
blessings to her people. One hundred families of Banu al-Mustaliq were
set free on account of her. </blockquote>

The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Mu'adh
through a different chain of narrators. After mentioning the words "If
any Muslim emancipates a Muslim slave and if a woman emancipates a
Muslim woman, this version adds: "If a man emancipates two Muslim women,
they will be his deliverance from Hell-fire; two bones of theirs will be
emancipation for each of his bone."
<p>
Abu Dawud said: Salim did not hear (traditions) from Shurahbil.
Shurahbil died at Siffin.

Narrated Abu Darda':
<p> 
The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: the similitude of a man who
emancipates a slave at the time of his death is like that of a man who
gives a present after satisfying his appetite.
