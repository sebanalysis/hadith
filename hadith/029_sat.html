then took signet-rings of gold. When he saw that they had taken
them (like his ring), he threw it away and said: I shall  never
wear it. He then fashioned a silver ring and engraved on it
"Muhammad, the Apostle of Allah." Then Abu Bakr wore it after
him, then 'Umar wore it after Abu Bakr, and then 'Uthman wore
it after 'Umar till it fell down in a well called Aris.
