Introduction to Translation of Sahih Bukhari
</h1>
<em><H3>Translator: M. Muhsin Khan</em></H3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Sahih Bukhari is a collection of sayings and deeds of Prophet Muhammad
(pbuh), also known as the <strong>sunnah</strong>.  The <em>reports</em> of the
Prophet's sayings and deeds are called <strong>ahadith</strong>. Bukhari
lived a couple of centuries after the Prophet's death and worked extremely
hard to collect his ahadith.  Each report in his collection was
checked for compatibility with the Qur'an, and the veracity of the chain of
reporters had to be painstakingly established.  Bukhari's collection is
recognized by the overwhelming majority of the Muslim world to be one of
the most authentic collections of the Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh).  
</p>

<p>
Bukhari (full name Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ismail bin Ibrahim bin
al-Mughira al-Ja'fai) was born in 194 A.H. and died in 256 A.H.  His
collection of hadith is considered second to none.  He spent sixteen years
compiling it, and ended up with 2,602 hadith (9,082 with repetition).  His
criteria for acceptance into the collection were amongst the most stringent
of all the scholars of ahadith.
</p>

<p>
It is important to realize, however, that Bukhari's collection is not
complete: there are other scholars who worked as Bukhari did and collected
other authentic reports.

<h3>Note for WWW Developers</h3>

<p>
Sahih Bukhari is divided into nine volumes, each of which has several
books. Each book contains many ahadith.  The ahadith are numbered
consecutively per <em>volume</em>.  The books really only serve to group
ahadith together, but the volumes impose the numbering.
</p>

<p>
MSA-USC has placed anchors (hyperlinks) for all the ahadith in the
translations presented here.  Prospective developers of Islamic sites may
find it useful to refer to these anchors.  For example, one could use the
anchors to create an 'active' subject index into Sahih Bukhari.
</p>

<p>
The format of the anchor names for the translated ahadith in Sahih Bukhari 
is very simple:
<blockquote>
<code>
DDD.DDD.DDD[A]
</code>
</blockquote>
where <code>D</code> stands for a digit and <code>[A]</code> means an
optional letter.  The first three digits are the volume number, the second
three digits are the book number, and the last three digits (with optional
letter) are the report number.  The format of the file names (one per book)
is:
<blockquote>
<code>
DDD_sbt.html
</code>
</blockquote>
The three digits are the book number, and <code>sbt</code> stands for Sahih
Bukhari Translation.  Given the anchor, you can tell which file it is found
in (e.g. 005.059.716 is found in 059_sbt.html).
</p>

<p>
For example, the following snippet of HTML should take you to volume 2,
book 16, number 108:
<blockquote>
<code>
<a href="016_sbt.html#002.016.108">
&lt;a href="016_sbt.html#002.016.108"&gt;SAMPLE&lt;/a&gt;
</a>
</code>
