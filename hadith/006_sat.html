I was a man who was more given than others to sexual intercourse with women.

So I made my wife like my mother's back to me till the end of Ramadan. But one night when she was waiting upon me, something of her was revealed. Suddenly I jumped upon her.

Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:
</p>



<p>

Hilal ibn Umayyah was one of three people whose repentance was accepted by Allah. One night he returned from his land and found a man with his wife. He witnessed with his eyes and heard with his ears. He did not threaten him till the morning.  
</p>


<p>

Next day he went to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) in the morning, and said: Apostle of Allah! I came to my wife at night and found a man with her. I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) disliked what he described and he took it seriously.  
</p>


<p>

Thereupon the following Qur'anic verse came down: "And those who make charges against their spouses but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them...." 
</p>


<p>

When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) came to himself (after the revelation ended), he said: Glad tidings for you, Hilal. Allah, the Exalted, has made it easy and, a way out for you.  
</p>


<p>

Hilal said: I expected that from my Lord.  The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Send for her. She then came. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) recited (the verses) to them that the punishment in the next world was more severe than that in this world.  
</p>


<p>

Hilal said: I swear by Allah, I spoke the truth against her. She said: He told a lie.  
</p>


<p>

The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Apply the method of invoking curses on each other. Hilal was told: Bear witness. So he bore witness before Allah four times that he spoke the truth.  
</p>


<p>

When he was about to utter a fifth time, he was told: Hilal, fear Allah, for the punishment in this world is easier than that in the next world; and this is the deciding one that will surely cause punishment to you.  
</p>


<p>

He said: I swear by Allah. Allah will not punish me for this (act), as He did not cause me to be flogged for this (act). So he bore witness a fifth time invoking the curse of Allah on him if he was one of those who told lies.  
</p>


<p>

Then the people said to her: Testify. So she gave testimony before Allah that he was a liar.  
</p>


<p>

When she was going to testify a fifth time, she was told: Fear Allah, for the punishment in this world is easier than that in the next world. This is the deciding one that will surely cause punishment to you.  
</p>


<p>

She hesitated for a moment, and then said: By Allah, I shall not disgrace my people. So she testified a fifth time invoking the curse of Allah on her if he spoke the truth.  
</p>


<p>

The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) separated them from each other, and decided that the child would not be attributed to its father. Neither she nor her child would be accused of adultery. He who accused her or her child would be liable to punishment. He also decided that there would be no dwelling and maintenance for her (from the husband), as they were separated without divorce.  
</p>


<p>

He then said: If she gives birth to a child with reddish hair, light buttocks, wide belly and light shins, he will be the child of Hilal. If she bears a dusky child with curly hair, fat limbs, fat shins and fat buttock he will be the child of the one who was accused of adultery. She gave birth to a dusky child with curly hair, fat limbs, fat shins and fat buttocks.  
</p>


<p>

The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Had there been no oaths I should have dealt with her severely.

The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: There is no prostitution in Islam. If anyone practised prostitution in pre-Islamic times, the child will be attributed to the master (of the slave-woman). He who claims his child without a valid marriage or ownership will neither inherit nor be inherited.

</p>



<p>

The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) decided regarding one who was treated as a member of a family after the death of his father, to whom he was attributed when the heirs said he was one of them, that if he was the child of a slave-woman whom the father owned when he had intercourse with her, he was included among those who sought his inclusion, but received none of the inheritance which was previously divided; he, however, received his portion of the inheritance which had not already been divided; but if the father to whom he was attributed had disowned him, he was not joined to the heirs. 
</p>


<p>

If he was a child of a slave-woman whom the father did not possess or of a free woman with whom he had illicit intercourse, he was not joined to the heirs and did not inherit even if the one to whom he was attributed is the one who claimed paternity, since he was a child of fornication whether his mother was free or a slave.

I was sitting with the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). A man came from the Yemen, and said: Three men from the people of the Yemen came to Ali, quarrelling about a child, asking him to give a decision. They had had sexual intercourse with a woman during a single state of purity.

He said to two of them: Give this child to this man (the third person) with pleasure. But they (refused and) cried loudly. Again he said to two of them: Give the child to the man (the third person) willingly. But they (refused and) cried loudly. He then said: You are quarrelsome partners. I shall cast lots among you; he who receives the lot, will acquire the child, and he shall pay two-thirds of the blood-money to both his companions. He then cast lots among them, and gave the child to the one who received the lot. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) laughed so much that his canine or molar teeth appeared.

<p>

Humayd ibn Nafi' reported the following three traditions on the authority of Zaynab, daughter of AbuSalamah:  
</p>


<p>

Zaynab said: I visited Umm Habibah when her father AbuSufyan, died. She asked for some yellow perfume containing saffron (khaluq) or something else. Then she applied it to a girl and touched her cheeks.  
</p>


<p>

She said: I have no need of perfume, but I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to observe mourning for one who has died, more than three nights, except for four months and ten days in the case of a husband.  
</p>


<p>

Zaynab said: I also visited Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh, when her brother died. She asked for some perfume and used it upon herself.  
</p>


<p>

She then said: I have no need of perfume, but I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say when he was on the pulpit: It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to observe mourning for one who has died, more than three nights, except for four months and ten days in the case of a husband.  
</p>


<p>

Zaynab said: I heard my mother, Umm Salamah, say: A woman came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and said: Apostle of Allah, the husband of my daughter has died, and she is suffering from sore eyes; may we put antimony in her eyes?  
</p>


<p>

The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: No. He said this twice or thrice. Each time he said: No. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: The waiting period is now four months and ten days. In pre-Islamic days one of you used to throw away a piece of dung at the end of a year.  
</p>


<p>

Humayd said: I asked Zaynab: What do you mean by throwing away a piece of dung at the end of a year.  
</p>


<p>

Zaynab replied: When the husband of a woman died, she entered a small cell and put on shabby clothes, not touching perfume or any other thing until a year passed. Then an animal such as donkey or sheep or bird was provided for her. She rubbed herself with it. The animal with which she rubbed herself rarely survived. She then came out and was given a piece of dung which she threw away. She then used perfume or something else which she desired.

When they met him at al-Qudum, they murdered him.

<p>

So I asked the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him): "Should I return to my people, for he did not leave any dwelling house of his own and maintenance for me?

She said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) replied: Yes.  She said: I came out, and when I was in the apartment or in the mosque, he called for me, or he commanded (someone to call me) and, therefore, I was called.  
</p>


<p>

He said: what did you say? So I repeated my story which I had already mentioned about my husband. Thereupon he said: Stay in your house till the term lapses. She said:

She said: Do not apply it except in the case of dire need which is troubling you. In that case you can use it at night, but you should remove it in the daytime.

He asked : What is this, Umm Salamah?  I replied: It is only the juice of aloes and contains no perfume.

I asked: What should I use when I comb myself, Apostle of Allah?  He said: Use lote-tree leaves and smear your head copiously with them.
