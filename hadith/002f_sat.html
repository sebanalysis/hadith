such a person. He may either punish him or admit him to Paradise.

<p>
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used to say at the end of his 
witr: "O Allah, I seek refuge in Thy good pleasure from Thy anger, and 
in Thy forgiveness from Thy punishment, and I seek refuge in Thy mercy 
from Thy wrath. I cannot reckon the praise due to Thee. Thou art as 
Thou hast praised Thyself."
<p>
Abu Dawud said: Hisham is the earliest teacher of Hammad. Yahya b. Ma'in 
said: No one is reported to have narrated traditions from him except 
Hammad b. Salamah.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: Ubayy b. K'ab said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)
recited supplication in the witr before bowing.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: This tradition has also been narrated by 'Isa b. Yunus
through a different chain of narrators from Ubayy b. K'ab. He also narrated
it through a diferent chain of narrators on the authority of Ubayy b. K'ab
that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) recited the supplication in
the witr before bowing.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: The chain of narrators of the tradition of Sa'id from
Qatadah goes: Yazid b. Zurai' narrated from Sa'id, from Qatadah , from 'Azrah,
from Sa'id b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abza, on the authority of his father from 
the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). This version does not mention the supplication
and the name of Ubayy. This tradition has also been narrated by 'Abd al-A'la
and Muhammad b. Bishr al-'Abdi. He heard traditions from 'Isa b. Yunus at 
Kufah. They did not mention the supplication in their version.
<p>
This tradition has also been narrated by Hisham al-Dastuwa'i and Shu'bah
from Qatadah. They did not mention the supplication in their version. The 
tradition of Zubaid has been narrated by Sulaiman, and Jarir b. Hazim; all
of them narrated on the authority of Zubaid. None of them mention the 
supplications in his version, except in tradition translated by Hafs b.
Ghiyath from Mis'ar from Zubaid; he narrated in his version that he (the
Prophet) recited supplications before bowing.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: This version of tradition is not well known. There is a doubt
that Hafs might have narrated this tradition from some other narrator than
Mis'ar.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: It is reported that Ubayy (b. K'ab) used to recite the
supplication (in the witr) in the second half of Ramadhan.

Al-Hasan reported: Umar ibn al-Khattab gathered the people (in tarawih 
prayer) behind Ubayy ibn Ka'b (who led them). He used to lead them for 
twenty days (during Ramadan, and would not recite the supplication except 
in the second half of it (i.e. Ramadan). When the last ten days remained, 
he kept away from them, and prayed in his house. They used to say: Ubayy 
ran away.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: This traditionshows that whatever has been reported about
the recitation of the supplication is not tenable. Moreover, these two
traditions from Ubayy b. K'ab indicate that another tradition which tells 
that the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) recited the supplication is weak.

a house of the houses of Allah (i.e. the mosque), reciting the
Book of Allah, and learning it together among themselves, but 
calmness (sakinah) comes down on them, (Divine) mercy covers 
them (from above), and the angels surround them, and Allah makes
a mention of them among those who are with him.

Once Sa'd, with the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), visited a woman 
in front of whom were some date-stones or pebbles which she was using as a 
rosary to glorify Allah. He (the Prophet) said: I tell you something which 
would be easier (or more excellent) for you than that. He said (it consisted 
of saying): "Glory be to Allah" as many times as the number of that which He 
has created in Heaven; "Glory be to Allah" as many times as the number of 
that which He has created on Earth; "Glory be to Allah" as many times as 
the number of that which He has created between them; "Glory be to Allah" 
as many times as the number of that which He is creating; "Allah is most 
great" a similar number of times; "Praise (be to Allah)" a similar number 
of times; and "There is no god but Allah" a similar number of times; "There 
is no might and no power except in Allah" a similar number of times.

<p>
The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used to teach us this supplication
as he taught us the surah from the Qur'an. He would say: "O Allah, I seek
refuge in thee from the punishment in Hell, I seek refuge in Thee from the
punishment in the Grave, I seek refuge from Thee from the testing of the
Antichrist (Dajjal), and I seek refuge in Thee from the trial of life and'
death."
