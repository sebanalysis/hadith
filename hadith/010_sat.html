Narrated 'Adi b. Hatim:
<p>
I asked the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), and said: I set my trained
dogs, and they catch (something) for me; may I eat (it)? He said:
When you set off trained dogs and mention Allah's name, eat what they
catch for you. I said: Even if they killed (the game)? He said: Even
if they killed (the game) so long as another dog does not join it. I
said: I shoot with a featherless arrow, and it strikes the target; may
I eat (it)? He said: If you shoot with a featherless arrow and mention
the name of Allah, and it strikes the aim, and pierce it, eat it; and
if it strikes with it middle, do not eat (it).

I asked the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). I said: We
hunt with these dogs. He replied: When you set off your dog and
mention Allah's name over it, eat what it caches for you, even if
it kills it, except that the dog has eaten (any of it); if the
dog has eaten (any of it), do not eat, for I am afraid it has
caught it only for itself.

and mention Allah's name, and you find it (the game) after a day,
and you do not find it in water, and you find in it only the mark
of your arrow, eat (it); but if another dog joins your dogs, do not
eat it, for you do not know maybe the one which was not yours has
killed it.

<p>
The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Eat what ever is caught
for you by a dog or a hawk you have trained and set off when
you have mentioned Allah's name. I said: (Does this apply) if
it killed (the animal)? He said: When it kills it without eating
any of it, for it caught it only for you.
<p>
Abu Dawud said: If a hawk eats any of it, there is no harm (in
eating it). If a dog eats it, it is disapproved (to eat the meat).
If it drinks blood, there is no harm (in eating it).

I asked: I set off my dog, and I find with it another dog? He replied:

There was a bedouin called AbuTha'labah. He said: Apostle of Allah,
I have trained dogs, so tell me your opinion about (eating) the
animal they hunt. The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: If you have
trained dogs, then eat what they catch for you. He asked: Whether
it is slaughtered or not? He replied: Yes. He asked: Does it apply
even if it eats any of it? He replied: Even if it eats any of it. He
again asked: Apostle of Allah, tell me your opinion about my bow (i.e.
the game hunted by arrow). He said: Eat what your bow returns to you,
whether it is slaughtered or not. He asked: If it goes out of my sight?
He replied: Even if it goes out of your sight, provided it has no stench,
or you find a mark on it other than the mark of your arrow. 
<p>
He asked: Tell me about the use of the vessels of the Magians when we
are forced to use them. He replied: Wash them and eat in them.
