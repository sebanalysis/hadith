<blockquote>
<p>
Mu'awiya b. al-Hakam said: While I was praying with the Messenger of
Allah (may peace be upon him), a man in the company sneezed.  I said: Allah have
mercy on you ! The people stared at me with disapproving looks, so I said: Woe be
upon me, why is it that you stare at me ?  They began to strike their hands on their 
thighs, and when I saw them urging me to observe silence (I became angry) but I  said
nothing.  When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said the prayer
(and I declare that neither before him nor after him have I seen a leader who gave
 better instruction than he for whom  I would give my father and mother as ransom).I
swear that he did not scold, beat or revile me but said: Talking to persons is not
fitting during the prayer, for it consists of glorifying Allah, declaring his Greatness.
and recitation of the Qur'an or words to that effect. I said: Messenger of Allah. I was
till recently a pagan, but Allah has brought Islam to us; among us there are men who
have recourse to Kahins. He said, Do not have recourse to them. I said.  There are
men who take omens. That is something which they find in their breasts, but let
it not turn their way (from freedom of action).I said: Among us there are men
who draw lines.  He said: There was a prophet who drew lines, so if they do it as
they did, that is allowable.I had a maid-servant who tended goats by the side of
Uhud and Jawwaniya. One day I happened to pass that way and found that a wolf
had carried a goat from her flock.  I am after all a man from the posterity of Adam.  I
felt sorry as they (human beings) feel sorry.  So I slapped her. I came to the Messenger
of Allah (may peace be upon him) and felt (this act of mine) as something grievous I
said: Messenger of Allah, should I not grant her freedom?  He (the Holy Prophet) said:
Bring her to me. So I brought her to him.  He said to her: Where is Allah?  She said:
He is in the heaven. He said: Who am I? She said: Thou art the Messenger of
Allah. He said: Grant her freedom, she is a believing woman.

Holy Prophet) reciting the Qur'an and making a sign with his head. When he com-
pleted the prayer he sa'id: What have you done (with regard to that business) for which
I sent you?  I could not talk with you but for the fact that I was engaged in prayer.

thee with Allah's curse" three times, then he stretched out his hand as though he was
taking hold of something.  When he finished the prayer, we said: Messenger of Allah,
we heard you say something during the prayer which we have not heard you say before,
and we saw you stretch out your hand.  He replied : Allah's enemy Iblis came with a
flame of fire to put it in my face, so I said three times: "I Seek refuge in Allah from
thee." Then I said three times: "I curse thee with Allah's full curse." But he did not
retreat (on any one of these) three occasions.  Thereafter I meant to seize him. I swear
by Allah that had it not been for the supplication of my brother Sulaiman he would
have been bound, and made an object of sport for the children of Medina.

on woods (to prepare a pulpit) so that I should talk to the people (sitting on it).  Abu
Hazim said: He (Sahl b. Sa'd) pointed out the name of (that lady) that day.  So he (the
carpenter) made (a pulpit) with these three steps. Then the Messengerof Allah (may peace
be upon him) commanded it to be placed here (where it is lying now).  It was fashioned out
of the wood  of al-Ghaba. And I saw the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon
him) standing upon it and glorifying Allah and the people also glorified Allah after him,

back (on his heels) till he prostrated himself at the base of pulpit, and then returned

was complete.  He then turned towards the people and said: O people, I have done it

decide this (problem so clearly) that one who reads the Qur'an, or one who does not read

Allah ! I call You witness on these governors of lands, that I sent them to (the peoples

religion and the Sunnah of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), and distribute

one night delayed the 'Isya' prayer till the people went to sleep. They woke up and again

"Prayer." Ata' further reported that Ibn 'Abbas said: The Apostle of Allah (may

Companions of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and who participated in
the (Battle of) Badr  and was among the Ansar (of Medina), told that he came to the
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, I have lost
my eyesight and I lead my people in prayer.  When there is a downpour there is then a
current (of water) in the valley that stands between me and them and I find it impossible 
to go to their mosque and lead them in prayer. Messenger of Allah, I earnestly
beg of you that you should come and observe prayer at a place of worship (in my house)
so that I should then use it as a place of worship. The Messenger of Allah (may peace
be upon him) said: Well, it God so wills. I would soon do so. 'Itban said: On the
following day  when the day dawned, the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him)
came along with Abu Bakr at-Siddiq, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon
him) asked permission (to get into the house). I gave him the permission, and be did
not sit after entering the house, when he said: At what place in your house you desire
me to say prayer? I ('Itban b. Malik) said: I pointed to a corner in the house, The
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood (at that place for prayer) and pronounced 
Allah-o-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) (as an expression for the commencement
of prayer).  We too stood behind him, and he said two rak'ahs and then pronounced
salutation (marking the end of the prayer).  We detained him (the Holy Prophet) for the
meat curry we had prepared for, him.  The people of the neighbouring houses came and
thus there was a good gathering in (our house).  One of them said: Where is Malik
b. Dukhshun?  Upon this one of them remarked: He is a hypocrite; he does not love
Allah and His Messenger.  Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)
said: Do not say so about him.  Don't you see that he utters La ilaha ill-Allah (There is
no god but Allah) and seeks the pleasure of Allah through it?  They said: Allah and His
Messenger know beet.  One (among the audience) said: We see his inclination and 
wellwishing for hypocrites only. Upon this the Messenger of Allah'(may peace be upon

Abu Salama b. Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf heard Abu Huraira say:
(When) Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) (wished to invoke curse or
blessing on someone, he would do so at the end) of the recitation in the dawn prayer,
when he had pronounced Allah-o-Akbar (for bending) and then lifted his head (saying):
"Allah listened to him who praised Him; our Lord ! to Thee is all praise"; he would
then stand up and say: "Rescue al-Walid b. Walid,  Salama b. Hisham, and
'Ayyash b. Abd Rabi'a, and the helpless among the Muslims. O Allah ! trample
severely Mudar and cause them a famine (which broke out at the time) of Joseph. O
Allah! curse Lihyan, Ri'l, Dhakwan, 'Usayya, for they disobeyed Allah and
His Messenger." (The narrator then adds): The news reached us that he abandoned
(this) when this verse was revealed: "Thou but no concern in the matter whether He
turns to them (mercifully) or chastises them ; surely they are wrongdoers" (ill. 127)

Lead the beasts on: so they led their camels to some distance.  The Messenger of Allah

the Iqama and then led them in the morning prayer.  When he finished the prayer he said:

Abu Qatida reported: The Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him)
addressed us and said: You would travel In the evening and the might till (God willing)
you would come in the morning to a place of water.  So the people travelled (self absorbed) 
without paying any heed to one another, and the Messenger of Allah (may
peace be upon him) also travelled till It was midnight. I was by his side.  The Messenger 
of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to doze and leaned (to one side) of his
camel.  I came to him and I lent him support without awaking him till he sat poised
on his ride.  He went on travelling till a major part of the night was over and (he again)
leaned (to one side) of his camel.  I supported him without awaking him till he sat
"bed on his ride. and then travelled till it was near dawn.  He (again) leaned which
was far more inclined than the two earlier leanings and he was about to fall down.  So
I came to him and supported him and he lifted his head and said ; Who is this?  I said:
it is Abu Qatida.  He (the Holy Prophet again) said: Since how long have you been
travelling along with me like this?  I said: I have been travelling in this very state
since the night.  He said: May Allah protect you, as you have protected His Apostle 
(from falling down), and again said: Do you see that we are hidden from the people?-
and again said: Do you see anyone? I said: Here is a rider.  I again said: Here Is
another rider till we gathered together and we were seven riders.  The Messenger of
Allah (may peace be upon him) stepped aside of the highway and placed his head (for
sleep and said): Guard for us our prayers.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon
him) was the first to wake up and the rays of the sun were falling on his back.  We got
up startled He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ride on So we rode on till the sun had
(sufficiently) risen.  He then came down from his camel and called for a jug of water
which I had with me.  There was a little water in that.  He performed ablution kith that
which was less   thorough as compared with his usual ablutions and some water of that
had been left.  He (the Holy Prophet) said to Abu Qatida: Keep a watch over your jug
of water; it would have (a miraculous) condition about it.  Then Bilal summoned
(people) to prayer and then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed
two rak'ahs and then said the morning prayer as he said every day.  The Messenger of
Allah (may peace be upon him) (then) rode on and we rode along with him and some of
us whispered to the others saying: How would there be compensation for omission in
our prayers?  Upon this he (the Apostle of Allah) said: Is there not in me (my life) a
model for you ? There is no omission in sleeping. The (cognizable) emission is that
one should not say prayer (intentionally) till the time of (he other prayer comes.  So
he who did like it (omitted prayer in sleep or due to other unavoidable circumstances)
should say prayer when he becomes aware of it and on the next day he should observe
it at its prescribed time.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: What do you think the people
would have done (at this hour)?  They would have in the morning found their Apostle
missing from amongst them and then Abu Bakr and 'Umar would have told them that
the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) must be behind you, he cannot leave
you behind (him), but the people said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon
him) is ahead of you.  So if you had obeyed Abu Bakr and Umar, you would have gone
on the right path. So we proceeded on till we came up to the people (from whom we had
lagged behind) and the day had considerably risen and everything became hot, and they
(the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said: Messenger of Allah, we are dying of thirst.
Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: There is no destruction for you.  And again
said: Bring that small cup of mine and he then asked for the jug of water to be brought
to him.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to pour water (in that
small cup) and Abu Qatida gave them to drink.  And when the people saw that there
was (a little) water in the jug, they fell upon it.  Upon this the Messenger of Allah
(may peace be upon him) said: Behave well; the water (is enough) to satiate all of you.
Then they (the Companions) began to receive (their share of) water with calmness
(without showing any anxiety) and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)
began to fill (the cap), and I began to serve them till no one was left except me and
the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).  He then filled (the cup) with water
and said to me: Drink it. I said: Messenger of Allah, I would not drink till you drink.
Upon this he said: The server of the people Is the last among them to drink. So I
drank and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) also drank and the people
came to the place of water quite happy and satiated.  'Abdullah b. Rabah said: I am
going to narrate this hadith in the great mosque, when 'Imran b. Husain said: See, O
young man, how will you narrate for I was also one of the riders on that night? I said:
So you must be knowing this hadith well.  He said: Who are you? I said: I am one of
the Ansar.  Upon this he said: You narrate, for you know your hadith better. I, therefore, 
narrated it to the people. 'Imran said: I was also present that night, but I know

to dawn, we got down for rest, and were overpowered (by sleep) till the sun shone.
Abu Bakr was the first to awake amongst us. and we did not awake the Apostle of
Allah (may peace be upon him) from his sleep allowing him to wake up (of his own
accord). It was 'Umar who then woke up.  He stood by the side of the Apostle of
Allah (may peace be upon him) and recited takbir in a loud voice till the Messenger of

had arisen; he then said: Proceed on.  He travelled along with us till the sun shone
brightly.  He came down (from his camel) and led us in the morning prayer.  A person,
however, remained away from the people and did not say, prayer along with us.  After
having completed the prayer, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to
him: O, so and so, what prevented you from observing prayer with us?  He said:
Apostle of Allah! I was not in a state of purity.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be
upon him) ordered him arid lie performed Tayammum with dust and said prayer.  He
then urged me to go ahead immediately along with other riders to find out water, for
we felt very thirsty.  We were traveling when we came across a woman who was sitting
(on a camel) with her feet hanging over two leathern water bags.  We said to her:
How far is water available? She , said: Far, very far, very far.  You cannot get water.
We (again) said: How much distance is there between (the residence of) your family
and water?  She said: It is a day and night journey.  We said to her: You go to the
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).  She said: Who is the Messenger of Allah ?
We somehow or the other managed to bring her to the Messenger of Allah (may peace
be upon him) and he asked about her, and she informed him as she had informed us
that she was a widow having orphan children.  He ordered that her camel should be
made to kneal down and he gargled in the opening (of her leathern water-bag).  The
camel was then raised up and we forty thirsty men drank water till we were completely
satiated, and we filled up all leathern water-bags and water-skins that we had with us
and we washed our companions, but we did not make any camel drink, and (the
leathern water-bags) were about to burst (on account of excess of water).  He then
said: Bring whatever you have with you.  So we collected the bits (of estable things)
and dates and packed them up in a bundle, and said to her : Take it away.  This is
meant for your children, and know that we have not its any way done any loss to your
water.W hen she came to her family she said: I have met the greatest magician amongst
human beings, or he is an apostle, as he claims to be, and she then narrated what had
happened and Allah guided aright those people through that woman.  She affirmed her
faith in Islam and so did the people embrace Islam.

observed the noon and afternoon prayers together in Medina without being in a state
of fear or in a state of journey. (Abu Zubair said: I asked Sa'id [one of the narrators]
why he did that.  He said: I asked Ibn 'Abbas as you have asked me, and he replied
that he [the Holy Prophet] wanted that no one among his Ummah should be put to
[unnecessary] hardship.)

combined the prayers as he set on a journey in the expedition to Tabuk.  He combined
the noon prayer with the afternoon prayer and the sunset prayer with the 'Isha'

He said: He wanted that his Ummah should not be put to (unnecessary) hardship.

'Abdullah b. Shaqiq reported: Ibn 'Abbas one day addressed us in the
afternoon (after the afternoon prayer) till the sun disappeared and the stars appeared,
and the people began to say: Prayer, prayer.  A person from Banu Tamim came there.
He neither slackened nor turned away, but (continued crying): Prayer, prayer.  Ibn
'Abbas said: May you be deprived of your mother, do you teach me Sunnah?  And
then he said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) combining the noon
and afternoon prayers and the sunset and 'Isha' prayers.  'Abdullah b. Shaqiq said:
Some doubt was created in my mind about it.  So I came to Abu Huraira and asked
him (about it) and he testified his assertion.
