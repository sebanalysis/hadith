<p>This compiliation has been edited by the author in August 1996 in order
to be compatible with the HTML code. The original file was a Wordperfect
5.1 for MS-DOS file. It was converted to Word 7.0 and to then to HTML.
The intention of launching this compilation on the Internet was pre-supposed,
however this was not done until now (August 1996). Taking advantage of
HTML coding/tags, navigation is made easier here as I have created links
to/from the endnotes and also to/from the table of contents. This file
is also available as a <A HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/sa/muslim/isl/hadiths.zip">Word
7.0</A> the <A HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/sa/muslim">Msa @ Suny Buffalo</A>
website. 


<P>I hope you will enjoy browsing/reading this compilation as much as I
enjoyed making it presentable. Thank you for your time and attention.

<P>Knowledge of ahadith is essential in an effort to understand Islam.
They contain rules and regulations, when implemented, would give cause
to a better understanding of everyday life. This is applicable, to the
individual of a society and also to the society as a whole. The messages
within the ahadith are for the benefit of both, individual and society.



<P>Among many missions of the Prophet (peace be upon him), one was to set
a pattern of conduct. The conduct of the Last Messenger (peace be upon
him) can be found in the voluminous sahihs. We should make an attempt to
abide by these rules. 


<P>It is unnecessary to mention that research of Islam is beyond the scope
of a single individual, a task unattainable in a man's lifetime, not to
say, impossible. To narrow my scope, I had decided to restrict myself to
ahadith (even this is a large area of study within Islam). I decided on
making a small collection of ahadith. This decision resulted in a minor
project that essentially consisted of reading diverse Islamic literature
and reading different aspects of Islam. I could, of course, have bought
one of many voluminous compilations of ahadith, but I was convinced that
I would learn more by finding and compiling them myself and indeed it has
been a most fruitful experience. During the compilation, I was becoming
aware of the meaning and importance of ahadith and soon realised that others
too could benefit from this compilation. With this in mind I was determined
to share this collection with my fellow Muslims. 


<P>All ahadith in this collection have been, so to say, copied from my
source <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#NA">(NOTE A)</A></FONT> <A NAME="NAR"></A>.Every
hadith is followed by the Arabic source it can be found in (e.g. Bukhari,
Muslim) along with the source I have written it from (e.g. Sayings of Muhammad
by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). If the reader feels uncertain about a particular
hadith she/he can easily trace it to my source. 


<P>All the footnotes in the ahadith are not my insertions, but the author's
of my sources. The titles which are given to the ahadith are also titles
found in my source, they too, are not my insertions. The same applies for
brackets ( ( ) or [] ) found within some ahadith. (These comments do not
apply to the titles marked as &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;Introduction
to Ahadith&quot;) The ahadith are all randomly compiled. The ahadith have
been written down as I have encountered them in relevant literature. 


<P>Since I have used different literature, there have come cases where
two authors use the same title, e.i. &quot;marriage&quot; hence the title
will appear twice. This is not to be regarded as a misprint. There is no
personal preference as to the choice of authors of my sources. I have obtained
these books from different libraries and local mosques. 


<P>A problem which was encountered was when two authors wrote on the same
subject matter, but from different sahihs, both sahihs had their own wordings
but giving the same meaning. I have tried to keep these sort of ahadith
to a minimal as I wished to have as many diverse topics as possible. Faith,
knowledge, marriage, sex, divorce, rights of wives/husbands and hospitality
are a couple of areas covered in this compilation. 


<P>I have, to the very best of my abilities, tried to be as careful as
possible when writing from the source, this in order not to endanger the
real meaning of the hadith, nor to give cause to misinterpretations. As
far as spellings are concerned, I have thoroughly checked it. The spellings
of Arabic names and places have been written exactly as I have encountered
them in the source. 


<P>One of my sources, &quot;Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen&quot; written by, Mohammad
Ashraf Ali Thanvi, has consistently used the term &quot;<I>Rasulullah</I>&quot;
when addressing Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him). The Arabic term,
&quot;<I>sallallahu alayhi wasallam</I>&quot; has also been used throughout
the book. For the ease of non-Muslim readers, I have replaced the Arabic
&quot;<I>Rasulullah</I>&quot; by &quot;Muhammad&quot; and &quot;<I>sallallahu
alayhi wasallam</I>&quot; by &quot;may the blessings and peace of Allah
be upon him.&quot; I have treated similarly the terms &quot;<I>radiallahu
anhu</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>radiallahu anha</I>.&quot; They have been replaced
by &quot;Allah be pleased with him&quot; and &quot;Allah be pleased with
her.&quot; I have used the term &quot;peace be upon him&quot; throughout
the compilation as most authors have used similar attributes. The same
author has also mentioned the narrators' Arabic names for most ahadith,
I have done likewise. 


<P>Considering the fact that I am a computer science student (August, 1993),
with access to Internet, I thought this would serve as a most remarkable
media for distribution of this collection. It is recommended, to those
readers who have the possibilities, to print out the file and <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#NB">(NOTE
B) <A NAME="NBR"></A></A></FONT>send a copy to the local mosques who might
wish to include this compilation in their library etc. If mosques have
the possibilities to print copies of this collection and have it distributed
among the visitors/guests to the mosques, it would be appreciated. Thus
the collection will not only be restricted to people with network access.
The more people who read it, the more it will benefit and also the one
who passes on the words of the Prophet (peace be upon him) will also be
rewarded by Allah. There is no doubt about this. This compilation is dedicated
to the loving memories of my maternal grandfather with whom I spent my
first years of a precious life.

Ahadith</A> </H1>

<P>It goes without saying that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has
left us with two powerful sources for the improvement of the individual,
the society and for the nations, those are: the Holy Quran and ahadith.
The Quran was revealed to the Last Messenger (peace be upon him) through
the angel Gabriel. The ahadith show us the diversities a single person
can have, and the ways these diversities may be used to produce an optimal
performance, where the performance is exemplary for future generations.
This was one of the main tasks of the Last Messenger (peace be upon him),
to guide humanity on the right path. 


<P>Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a son, a husband, a father, an advisor,
a warrior, a leader, a judge and most important of all, he was the Seal
of the Prophets - the last messenger of Allah. A man with such a character
and such a vast field of responsibility is indeed deserving of biographical
study, and through the ages, biographical researches have been carried
out. The collection of ahadith is the result of these researchers. The
study of ahadith is a science itself. To mention some branches within the
study of ahadith, there is the science of <I>Asma'ul Rijal</I> (the science
of study of the life-history of 500,000 narrators), the science of <I>Mustalih
al-Hadith</I> (the science of classifying a hadith as authentic or weak),
the science of <I>Gharib al-hadith</I> (the study of the linguistic origins
of the difficult words used in ahadith). I have mentioned only three different
sciences though this list can extend to over 100. This again indicates
the immense importance of ahadith and the importance of understanding them.



<P>The main source of ahadith can be found in six sahihs <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#NC">(NOTE

<P>&quot;In preparing their collections, these Traditions obviously used
a critical technique to decide what they would include and what they should
reject. Bukhari, for example, examined 600,000 traditions of which he excepted
only 7,397. There purpose was to assemble a body of traditions which would
serve as a rule of life for practising Muslims, so their primary interest
was in selecting such traditions as would give clear guidance concerning
what Muslims belief and practice should be, what things were permissible
and approved, and what were not permissible and disapproved.&quot; <BR>
(Shariah: The Islamic Law. by Abdur Rahman I. Doi:54) 

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It should be quite evident from the above cited paragraph that the task
of compiling ahadith was by no means simple. Although the most painstaking
techniques had been employed to decide which ahadith should be included
and which should be rejected there were found grounds for classification
of ahadith. The ahadith are therefore classified in the following manner:



<BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL>
<P><LI><I>Sahih</I>: These are the genuine Traditions so declared after applying
all tests.<BR>
<LI><I>Hasan</I>: These are the fair Traditions although inferior in the
matter of authenticity to the Sahih.<BR>
<LI><I>Daif</I>: These are the weak traditions which are not so very reliable.&quot;<BR>
(Ibid:57). 
</OL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Before I proceed, I wish to explain the meanings of <I>isnad </I>and
<I>matn </I>as the understanding of these words is considered profitable
for the reader. A hadith consists of two parts. The chain of transmitters
comprises one part while the message within the hadith completes it. The
former is known as <I>isnad </I>while the latter is <I>matn</I>. Continuing
with the classification of ahadith, the <I>daif </I>ahadith are divided
further: 


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><OL TYPE=a>
<LI> The <I>Mu'allaq </I>Traditions: These are those Traditions in which
one or two transmitters are omitted in the beginning of the Isnad.<BR>
<LI> The<I> Maqtu</I> Traditions: These are those Traditions which are reported
by a Tabi'i, a man of second category after the Prophet. <BR>
<LI> The <I>Munqati</I> Traditions: These are the broken Traditions. <BR>
<LI> The <I>Mursal</I> Traditions: These are the incomplete Traditions in
the Isnad of which a companion (Sahabi) is omitted, e.g. A Tabi'i says,
the Prophet said....<BR>
<LI> The <I>Musahhaf</I> Traditions: These are the traditions which have
a mistake in words or letters of the Isnad or the Matn e.g. Hasan is written
as Hashan.<BR>
<LI> The <I>Shadh</I> Traditions: These are the traditions with a reliable
chain of reporters but their meanings are contrary to other similarly attested
Traditions narrated by the majority of the contemporary transmitters.<BR>
<LI> The <I>Maudu</I> Traditions: These are the fabricated and untrue Traditions.&quot;<BR>
(Ibid:57).

<P>I have now presented a very short introduction to the background of
ahadith. I would most strongly recommend the interested reader to read
the book &quot;Shariah: The Islamic Law&quot; by Abdur Rahman I. Doi. It
is a book which I have used extensively and found most interesting and
informative. The same author has also published a book which is titled
&quot;Non-Muslims under Shariah&quot;, another informative book which I
would recommend. 


<P>Lastly I would like to thank the people concerned in providing me with
the facility for distributing this collection. Without their help, time,
and effort, I am quite certain that this work would not have come to the
notice of so many people in so many places. May Allah give them peace and
bless them all. Amen.

<P>1. Islam is based on five things: the testimony that there is no god
but Allah and that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)
is His servant and messenger, the observance of the prayer, the payment
of Zakat, the pilgrimage, and the fast during Ramadan.<BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). 


<P>2. The Muslim is he from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe,
and the Emigrant is he who abandons what God has prohibited. <BR>
(Bukhari).<BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). 


<P>3. None of you believes till I am dearer to him than his father, his
child and all mankind.<BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad) 


<P>4. He who is not trustworthy has no Faith, and he who does not keep
his Covenant has no religion.<BR>
(Baihaqi).<BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). 


<P>5. What is Faith? When your good deed pleases you and your evil deed
grieves you, you are a believer. What is Sin? When a thing disturbs (the
peace of) your heart, give it up. <BR>
(Ahmad).<BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

MAJOR SINS AND SIGNS OF HYPOCRISY</B></U></A></FONT> </H1>

<P>6. The major sins are associating other objects of worship with God,
disobedience to parents, murder, and deliberate perjury. <BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). 


<P>7. There are three signs of a hypocrite: when he speaks he speaks lies,
when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is trusted he betrays
his trust. <BR>
(Bukhari).<BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). 


<P>8. Avoid the seven noxious things.(1) Associating anything with God,
(2) magic,(3) killing one whom God has declared inviolate without a just
cause, (4) devouring usury, (5) consuming the property of an orphan, running
back from the battlefield and, (7) slandering chaste women who are believers
but indiscreet.<BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim). <BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). 


<P>9. Four characteristics constitute anyone who possesses them a sheer
hypocrite, and anyone who possesses one of them possesses a characteristic
of hypocrisy till he abandons it: when he is trusted he betrays his trust,
when he talks he lies, when he makes a covenant he acts treacherously and
when he quarrels he abuses. <BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). 


<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="KNOWLEDGE"></A><FONT SIZE=+2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#TOC"><B><U>

<P>10. When a man dies no further reward is recorded for his actions, with
three exceptions: Sadqa which continues to be supplied, or knowledge from
which benefit continues to be reaped, or the prayers of a good son to his
dead father.<BR>

<P>191. Anas said: I served the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him) for ten years and he never said to me, &quot;Shame!&quot; or
&quot;Why you do such and such?&quot; or &quot;Why did you not do such
and such.&quot;<BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). 


<P>192. Jabir said that when God's messenger (peace and blessings of Allah

<P>194. Anas told that when a man had asked the Prophet (peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him) for enough sheep to fill the valley between two mountains

that there is no fear of poverty.<BR>
(Muslim).<BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). 


<P>195. Anas said: God's messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him) was one of the men in character. One day he sent me to do something,
and I said, &quot;I swear by God that I will not go.&quot; But in my heart
I felt I should go to do what God's messenger (peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him) has commanded me, so I went out and came upon some boys who
were playing in the street. All of a sudden God's messenger (peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him) who had come up behind caught me by the
back of the neck, and when I looked at him he was laughing. He said, &quot;Did
you go where I ordered you, little Anas?&quot; &quot;Yes, I am on my way,
messenger of God.&quot; (Muslim).<BR>
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). 


<P>199. If anyone of you sees something objectionable, he should change
it with his hand, but if he cannot, he should change it with his tongue,
and if he cannot he should do it in his heart, that being the weakest form
of faith.<BR>

(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). 


<P>200. Anas told that when God's messenger (peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him) shook hands with a man, he did not withdraw his hand till
the other did so, and he was not seen to put forward his knees in front
of one with whom he was sitting.<BR>

<P>201. Hind, son of Khadija from her former husband, says about the Prophet
(peace be upon him): &quot;Kind of heart, he was nice and sweet-tempered.
He never liked to displease or cause offence to anybody. He thanked even
for trifling favours. He took whatever food was placed before him, without
making any adverse remark. He never got angry for anything concerning his
own person, nor did he think of taking revenge or letting down anybody,
but if anyone opposed what was just and right, he used to get sore and
helped the right cause with all his might.

<P>203. Verily the creation of each one of you is brought together in his
mother's belly for forty days in the form of a seed, then he is a clot
of blood for a like period, then a morsel of flesh for a like period, then
there is sent to him the angel who blows the breath of life into him and
who is commanded about four matters <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N2">(NOTE 2)
<A NAME="N2R"></A></A></FONT>to write down his means of livelihood, his
life span, his actions, and whether happy or unhappy. By Allah, other than
Whom there is no god, verily one of you behaves like the people of Paradise
until there is but an arm's length between him and it, and that which has
been written overtakes him and so he behaves like the people of Hell-fire
and thus enters it; and one of you behaves like the people of Hell-fire
until there is but an arm's length between him and it, and that which has
been written overtakes him and so he behaves like the people of Paradise
and thus enters it.<BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>204. Actions are but by intention and every man shall have but that which
he intended. Thus he whose migration <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N3">(NOTE
3) <A NAME="N3R"></A></A></FONT>was for Allah and His Messenger, and he
whose migration was to achieve some worldly benefit or to take some woman
in marriage was for that he for which he migrated.<BR>

<P>209. Hazrat Umar (Allah be pleased with him) said: One day while we were
sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) there appeared
before us a man whose clothes were exceedingly white and whose hair was
exceedingly black; no signs of journeying were to be seen on him and none
of us knew him. He walked and sat down by the Prophet (peace be upon him).
Resting his knees against his and placing the palm of his hands on his
thigh, he said: O Muhammad, tell me about Islam. The Messenger of Allah
(peace be upon him) said: Islam is to testify that there is no god but
Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to perform the prayers, to
pay the <I>zakat</I> <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N4">(NOTE 4) <A NAME="N4R"></A></A></FONT>,
to fast in Ramadan, and to make the pilgrimage to the House <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N5">(NOTE
5) <A NAME="N5R"></A></A></FONT>if you are able to do so. He said: You
have spoken rightly, and we were amazed at him asking him and saying that
he had spoken right. He said: Then tell me about <I>iman</I> <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N6">(NOTE
6) </A></FONT>. <A NAME="N6R"></A>The Prophet (may the blessings and peace
of Allah be upon him ) said: It is to believe in Allah, His angels, His
books, His messengers and the Last Day, and to believe in divine destiny,
both the good and evil thereof. He said: You have spoken rightly. He said:
Then tell me about <I>ihsan</I> <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N7">(NOTE 7) </A></FONT>,<A NAME="N7R"></A>
The Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him ) said: It
is to worship Allah as though you are seeing Him, and while you see Him
not yet truly He sees you. He said then tell me about the Hour <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N8">(NOTE
8) </A></FONT>,<A NAME="N8R"></A> The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
The one questioned about it knows no better than the questioner. He said:
Tell me about its signs. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The slave-girl
will give birth to her mistress <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N9">(NOTE 9) <A NAME="N9R"></A></A></FONT>and
that you will see the barefooted naked, destitute herdsmen competing in
constructing lofty buildings. Then he took himself off and I stayed for
a time. Then the Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon)
said: O Umar, do you know who the questioner was? I said: Allah and hid
Messenger know best. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: It was Gabriel,
who came to you to teach you your religion.<BR>
(Muslim).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>210. That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain
and between the two if them are doubtful matters about which not many people
know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his
religion and his honour, but he who falls into doubtful matters falls into
that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around the sanctuary,
all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allah's
sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh
which, if diseased, all of it is diseased. Truly it is the heart. <BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>211. What I have forbidden to you, avoid; what I have ordered you [to
do], do as much of it as you can. It was only their excessive questioning
and their disagreeing with their Prophets that destroyed those who were
before you.<BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>212. Leave that which makes you in doubt for that which does not make
you doubt.<BR>
(Tirmidhi, Nasai).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>213. Part of someone's being a good Muslim is his leaving alone that
which does not concern him.<BR>
(Tirmidhi).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>214. Fear Allah wherever you are, and follow up a bad deed with a good
deed and it will wipe it out, and behave well towards people. <BR>
(Tirmidhi).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>215. Purity is half of faith. Al-hamdu lillah [Praise be to Allah] fills
the scales, and Subhana 'llah [How far is Allah from every imperfection]
and Al-hamdu lillah [Praise be to Allah] fill that which is between heaven
and earth. Prayer is light; charity is a proof; patience is illumination;
and the Quran is an argument for or against you. Everyone starts his day
and is a vendor of his soul, either freeing it or bringing about its ruin.<BR>
(Muslim).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>216. I have been ordered to fight <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N10">(NOTE
10) <A NAME="N10R"></A></A></FONT>against people until they testify that
there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and
until he perform the prayers and pay the zakat, and if they do so, they
will have gained protection from me for their lives <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N11">(NOTE
11) <A NAME="N11R"></A></A></FONT>and property, unless [they do acts that
are punishable] in accordance with Islam, and their reckoning will be with
Allah the Almighty. <BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>217. Verily Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things. Thus, if
you kill, kill well; and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let each one
of you sharpen his blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.<BR>
(Muslim).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>218. There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.<BR>
(Ibn Majah and Daraqutni).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>219. Allah the Almighty is good and accepts only that which is good.
Allah has commanded the Messengers, and the Almighty has said: &quot;<B>O
ye Messengers! Eat of the good things and do right.</B>&quot; <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N12">(NOTE
12) <A NAME="N12R"></A></A></FONT>And Allah has said: &quot;<B>O ye who
believe ! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you</B>.&quot;
<FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N13">(NOTE 13) <A NAME="N13R"></A></A></FONT>Then
the Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned [the case of] a man who, having
journeyed far, is dishevelled and dusty and who spreads out his hands to
the sky [saying]: O Lord! O Lord! - while his food is unlawful, his drink
unlawful, his clothing unlawful, and he is nourished unlawfully, so how
can he be answered!<BR>
(Muslim). <BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>220. Among the words people obtained from the First Prophecy <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N14">(NOTE
14) <A NAME="N14R"></A></A></FONT>are: If you feel no shame, then do as
you wish. <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N15">(NOTE 15) <BR>
<A NAME="N15R"></A></A></FONT>(Bukhari).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>221. None of you [truly] believes until his inclination is in accordance
with what I ((Muhammad), may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him
) have brought.<BR>
(Kitab al-Hujja).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>222. Righteousness is good morality, and wrongdoing is that which wavers
in your soul and which you dislike people finding out about. <BR>
(Muslim). <BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>223. Allah the Almighty has laid down religious duties, so do not neglect
them; He has set boundaries, so do not overstep them; He has prohibited
some things, so do not violate them; about some things He was silent out
of compassion for you, not forgetfulness, so seek not after them.<BR>
(Daraqutni)<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>224. Each person's every joint must perform a charity every day they
comes up: to act justly between two people is a charity; to help a man
with his mount, lifting him onto it or hoisting up his belongings onto
it is a charity; a good word is a charity; every step you take to prayers
(i.e. on your way to the mosque) is a charity and removing a harmful thing
from the road is a charity. <BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>225. The blood of a Muslim may not be legally spilt other than in one
of three [instances]: the married person commits adultery; a life for life;
and one who forsakes his religion and abandons the community.<BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>226. Were people to be given in accordance with their claim, men would
claim the fortunes and lives <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N16">(NOTE 16) <A NAME="N16R"></A></A></FONT>of
[other] people, but the onus of proof is on the claimant and the taking
of an oath is the incumbent upon him who denies.<BR>
(Al-Baihaqi).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>227. Hadhrat Abu Bakr Siddique (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that
the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &quot;A man who harms a Muslim and
deceives him, is accursed.&quot;<BR>
(Tirmidhi).<BR>
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi). 


<P>228. Allah has pardoned for me my people for [their] mistakes and [their]
forgetfulness and for what they have done under duress. <BR>
(Ibn Majah, Baihaqi).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>229. Allah has written down the good deeds and the bad ones. Then He
explained it [by saying that] he who has intended a good deed and has not
done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if
he intended it and has done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as from
ten good deeds to seven hundred times, or many times over. But if he has
intended a bad deed and has not done it, Allah writes it down with Himself
as a full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Allah writes
it down as one bad deed.<BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by . Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>230. Do not envy one another; do not inflate prices one to another; do
not hate one another; do not turn away from one another; and do not undercut
one another, but be you. O servants of Allah, brothers. A Muslim is the
brother of a Muslim: he neither oppresses him nor does he fail him, he
neither lies to him nor does he hold him in contempt. Piety is right here-and
the Prophet (peace be upon him) pointed to his breast three times. It is
evil enough for a man to hold his brother Muslim in contempt. The whole
of a Muslim for another is inviolable: his blood, his property and his
honour.<BR>
(Muslim).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>231. Some of the Companions <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N17">(NOTE 17)<A NAME="N17R"></A></A></FONT>
of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to the Prophet:(peace
be upon him) O Messenger of Allah, the affluent have made off with the
rewards: they pray as we pray, they fast as we fast, and they give away
in charity the superfluity of their wealth. The Prophet (peace be upon
him) said: Has not Allah made things for you to give away in charity? Truly
every <I>tasbiha <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N18">(NOTE 18)<A NAME="N18R"></A></A></FONT>
is a charity every takbira <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N19">(NOTE 19)<A NAME="N19R"></A></A></FONT>
is a charity, every tahmida <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N20">(NOTE 20)<A NAME="N20R"></A></A></FONT>
is a charity and every tahlia <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N21">(NOTE 21)<A NAME="N21R"></A></A></FONT>
is a charity; to enjoin a good action is a charity, to forbid an evil action
is a charity and in a sexual act each of you there are a charity. They
said: O Messenger of Allah, when one of us fulfils his sexual desire will
he have some reward for that? The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Do
you [not] think that were he to act upon it unlawfully he wold be sinning?
Likewise, if he has acted upon it lawfully he will have a reward.<BR>
</I>(Muslim). <BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>232. Allah the Almighty has said: Whosoever shows enmity to a friend
of Mine, I shall be at war with him. My servant does not draw near to Me
with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have imposed
upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory
works so that I shall love him. When I love him, I am his hearing with
which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hands with which he
strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of
Me, I would surely give it to him; and were he to ask me for refuge, I
would surely grant him it. <BR>
(Bukhari).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>233. The son of Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) use to say:
At evening do not expect [to live till] morning, and at morning do not
expect [to live till] evening. Take from your health for your illness and
from your life for your death <FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N22">(NOTE 22)</A></FONT>.<A NAME="N22R"></A>
<BR>
(Bukhari).<BR>
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).



<P>234. A man came to the Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah
be upon him ) and said: O Messenger of Allah, direct me to an act which,
if I do it, [will cause] Allah to love me and people to love me. The Prophet
(peace be upon him) said: Renounce the world and Allah will love you, and
renounce what people possess and people will love you. <BR>

memory and understood it. Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him) awarded the punishment of stoning to death (to the married
adulterer and adulteress) and after him, we also awarded the punishment
of stoning to death. I am afraid that, with the lapse of time, the people
(may forget it) and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning to
death in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty
prescribed by Allah. Stoning to death is a duty laid down in Allah's Book
for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established.<BR>

adultery? They said: We darken their faces and make them ride on the donkey
with their faces turned to the opposite direction (and their backs touching
each other) and then they are taken round (the city). He said: Bring the
Torah if you are truthful. They brought it and recited it until when they
came to the verse pertaining to stoning, the person who was reading placed
his hand on the verse pertaining to stoning, and read (only that which
was) between his hands and what was subsequent to that. Abdullah b. Salam
who was at that time with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him) said: Command him (the reciter) to lift his hand. He
lifted his hand and there was, underneath that, the verse pertaining to
stoning. Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pronounced
judgement about both of them and they were stoned. Abdullah b. Umar said:
I was one of those who stoned them, and I saw him (the Jew) protecting
her (the Jewess with his body). <BR>

rain water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it
for drinking, making their animals drink from it and for irrigation of
the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could
neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then the land did not
give any benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends
Allah's religion and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah has
revealed through me (the Prophet) and learns and then teaches others. The
last example is that of person who does not care for it and does not take
Allah's guidance revealed through me (He is like the barren land).&quot;

he might give a reply which would displease them. But some of them insisted

is the spirit?&quot; The Prophet (peace be upon him) remained quiet. I
thought he was being inspired Divinely. So I stayed till that state of
the Prophet (while being inspired) was over. The Prophet (peace be upon

someone came to me and cut my body open from here to here.&quot; I asked
Al-Jarud who was by my side, &quot;It means from his throat to his pubic
area,&quot; or said, &quot;from the top of the chest.&quot; The Prophet
(peace be upon him) further said, &quot;He then took out my heart. Then
a gold tray full of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and
was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then
a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey,
was brought to me.&quot; (on this Al-Jarud asked, &quot;Was it the Buraq,
O Abu Hamza?&quot; I (i.e. Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet
(peace be upon him) said, &quot;The animal's step (was so wide that it)
reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal's sight. I was
carried on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest
heaven. When he asked for the gate to be opened it was asked, 'Who is it?'
Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel
replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has Muhammad been called?' Gabriel
replied in affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent
visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went over the first heaven,
I saw Adam there. 


<P>Gabriel said (to me), 'This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.'
So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are
welcomed, o pious son and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me
till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened.
It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who
is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he
been called?' Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He
is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened, and
when I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yaya (i.e. John) and Isa
(i.e. Jesus), who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), 'These
are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.' So I greeted them and both
of them returned my greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed, o pious
brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third
heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?'
Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel
replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied
in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent
visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went over the third heaven,
there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Joseph; pay him your
greetings.' So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said,
'You are welcomed, o pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended
with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was
asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying
you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?'
Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed.
What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went over
the fourth heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Idris;
pay him your greetings.' So I greeted him and he returned the greetings
to me and said, 'You are welcomed, o pious brother and pious Prophet.'
Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate
to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel' It
was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was
asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it
was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was
opened, and when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e.
Aron) Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Aron; pay him your greetings.' So
I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed,
o pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me to the
sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is
it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?'
Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel
replied in the affirmative. It was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent
visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went (over the sixth heaven),
there I saw Moses. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Moses; pay him your greetings.'
So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You are
welcomed, o pious brother and pious Prophet.' When I left him (i.e. Moses)
he wept. Someone asked, 'What makes you weep?' Moses said, 'I weep because
after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will
enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.' Then Gabriel ascended
with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was
asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying
you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?'
Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, 'He is welcomed. What
an excellent visit his is!' So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there
I saw Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is your father; pay him your
greetings.' So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said,
'You are welcomed, o pious son and pious Prophet.' Then I was made to ascend
to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of the farthest limit). Behold!
Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and its
leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, 'This is the
Lote Tree of the farthest limit.' Behold! There ran four rivers, two were
hidden and two were visible. I asked, 'What are these two kinds of rivers,
O Gabriel?' He replied, 'As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers
in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.' Then
Al-Bait-ul-Ma'mur (i.e.the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container
full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought
to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, 'This is the Islamic religion
which you and your followers are following.' Then the prayers were enjoined
on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses
who asked (me), 'What have you been ordered to do?' I replied, 'I have
been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.' Moses said, 'Your followers
cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before
you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israil (in vain). Go back
to your Lord and ask for reducing your followers' burden.' So I went back,
and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he
repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah
and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the
same, I went back and Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a
day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went
back to Allah was ordered to observe five prayers a day. When I came back
to Moses, he said, 'What have you been ordered?' I replied, 'I have been
ordered to observe five prayers a day.' He said, 'Your followers cannot
bear five prayers a day,<FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N36">(NOTE 36)<A NAME="N36R"></A></A></FONT>
and no doubt, I have got an experience of the people before you, and I
have tried my level best with Bani Israil, so go back to your Lord and
ask for reducing your followers' burden.' I said, 'I have requested so
much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender
to Allah's order.' When I left, I head a voice saying, 'I have passed My
Order and have reduced the burden of My Worshippers.'&quot; <BR>

Allah Ta'ala records one and a half thousand good deeds for every Sajdah

during Ramadhan) from the time of Fajr Salat until sunset, seventy thousand
Malaaikah supplicate for his forgiveness. In return for every Sajdah which
he (the fasting person) makes, of any Salat, whether during the day or

<P>487. Hadhrat Thaubaan (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad
(peace be upon him) said: &quot;There will soon come a time when all nations
(of the kufaar) will unite against you ( Muslims)...&quot; Someone asked:
&quot;Will we be less in numbers at that time?&quot; Muhammad (peace be
upon him) said: 'In fact, you will be numerous, but useless...Allah Ta'ala
will remove your respect and your fears from the hearts of your enemies
(who will then despise you) and Allah will instil weakness in your hearts.&quot;
Someone asked: 'What is the cause of the weakness?' Muhammad (peace be
upon him) said: &quot;Love of the world and detestation for Maut.&quot;

<P>491. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: &quot;He who recites the Qur'an
well and clearly is equal in rank to the Angels who record creation's deeds.
These Angels are gracious, honourable and of lofty rank. He who finds difficulty
in reciting the Qur'an will obtain a double reward.&quot; <BR>
(Bukhari, Muslim).<BR>
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi). 


<P>492. A person whose breast is devoid of the Qur'an (i.e. has not learnt
anything of the Qur'an Majeed) is like a desolate house. <BR>
(Tirmidhi).<BR>
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi). 


<P>493. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: &quot;A person who recites one
harf (letter) of the Qur'an, obtains one virtue; each virtue multiplies
to ten virtues. I am not saying that (ALM) is one harf. But, Alif in it
is one harf; the Laam in it is one harf and the Meem in it is one harf.&quot;
<BR>
(Tirmidhi, Darimi).<BR>
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi). 


<P>494. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: &quot;On the day of Qiyaamah
a crown of such brilliance will be placed on the heads of the parents of
one who learnt the Qur'an and practised on its laws, that its glitter will
outshine the brilliance of the sun which penetrates your houses. What then
do you think will be the position of the one who himself learnt the Qur'an
and acted in accordance with it?&quot; <BR>
(Ahmad, Abu Dawud).<BR>
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi). 


<P>495. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: &quot;He who recites the Qur'an,
memorizes it,accepts its halal (lawful things) as halal and haram (forbidden
things) as haram (i.e. his beliefs in these matters are correct), Allah
Ta'ala will enter him to Jannat and accept his intercession on behalf of
ten such persons of his family upon whom entry into Janhannum has become
incumbent (i.e. Allah Ta'ala will forgive them because of his intercession).&quot;
<BR>
(Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Darimi).<BR>
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi). 


<P>496. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: &quot;Continue reciting the Qur'an
because on the Day of Qiyaamah it will appear as an intercessor for the
reciter.&quot; <BR>
(Muslim).<BR>
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi). 


<P>497. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: &quot;He who listens to even
a single aayat (being recited by another) obtains such a virtue which perpetually
multiplies (it increases in thawaab continuously). The one who recited
the aayat will on the Day of Qiyaamah find the recited aayat in the form
of a Noor (which will be of greater value and significance than the virtue
which accrued to the one who had listened to the recitation).&quot; <BR>
(Ahmad).<BR>
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi). 


<P>498. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: &quot;The best of you are those
who learn the Qur'an and teach it.&quot; <BR>
(Bukhari).<BR>
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi). 


<P>499. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: &quot;On the Day of Qiyaamah
the Qur'an will petition Allah to cloak the one who had recited it with
garments of honour and respect. A crown of honour will then be placed on
the head of the reciter. The Qur'an will then petition Allah Ta'ala to
shower His pleasure on the reciter. Allah will then become pleased with
him. The reciter will then be asked to recite the Qur'an, thereby attaining
higher ranks of elevation. In reward for each aayat a virtue will accrue
to him.&quot; <BR>
(Tirmidhi, Ibn Khuzaimah).<BR>
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi). 


<P>500. Continue climbing (higher and higher in rank) with your recitation
in the same way as you recited with care and concern on earth. Your abode
(of residing) is located (at that rank attained) with the last aayat recited.

<BR>A hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) refers a saying to
Allah, the Prophet himself being merely the narrator. Unlike the Quran,
one cannot say of a hadith qudsi that &quot;Allah said it.&quot; In the

Prophet's, transmitted to him either through a vision or revelation.

<BR>The superiority of race over race and family over family is recognised
-people are mines like mines of gold and silver- among Muslims as well
as non Muslims, but it is added that this superiority is maintained through
attainment of knowledge. If persons belonging to a superior race discard
knowledge, they lose their superiority. Racial or family superiority is
thus subject to the acquisition of knowledge.

<P><BR>
<A NAME="N33"></A><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N33R">(NOTE 33)</A>
<BR>The technical word for temporary marriage is mut'ah. It is derived
from mata meaning profiting for a long time. Mut'ah is considered to be
a legal form of marriage by the Shi'ahs, but the vast majority of the Muslim
community rejects it in the basis of this hadith quoted here. The Holy
Quran uses the word ihsan (lit. being inaccessible) for marriage, and thus
looks upon marriage as a permanent relation which can be cut off only by
divorce. For all of the kinds of sexual relationship it uses the word safah,
which signifies fornication. According to some hadith, mut'ah was allowed
by the Holy Prophet in a war. Even if this be true, it may have been allowed
at an earlier stage, reform having been brought about gradually, but there
is not the least doubt that it was finally disallowed.

<A NAME="N36"></A><A HREF="hadith_500.html#N36R">(NOTE 36)</A>
<BR>Iqamat -us-Salat: The offering of the prayers perfectly. This is not
understood by many Muslims. It means:<BR>
A) All members of a family or group etc., of a town or a village etc.,
must offer the prayers; all the males in the mosque for the five congregational
prayers and the females in their houses both young and old from seven years
and upwards, (and no member of the family is to be excused) at the five
fixed stated hours for the five compulsory prayers. If any member intentionally
did not offer the prayer, then even if the others prayed, they did not
offer the prayer (dutifully and perfectly). Each chief (of a family or
a town or a village etc.,) is responsible for it before Allah.<BR>
B) To offer a prayer in a way just as the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon
him) offered it with all its rules and regulations.
